  .SYNOPSIS
 Use this cmdlet to install CNTK from a precompiled binary drop (see https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/releases)

 .DESCRIPTION
 The script will download and install the CNTK prerequisites and Anaconda environment

 It will analyse your machine and will determine which components are required. 
 The required components will be downloaded and cached.
 Repeated operation of this script will reuse already downloaded components.

 - If required VS2012 Runtime and VS2013 Runtime will be installed
 - If required MSMPI will be installed
 - Anaconda3 will be installed into [<AnacondaBasePath>]
 - A CNTK-PY34 environment will be created or updated in [<AnacondaBasePath>\envs]
 - CNTK will be installed or updated in the CNTK-PY34 environment
 
 .PARAMETER Execute
 This is an optional parameter. Without setting this switch, no changes to the machine setup/installation will be performed

 .PARAMETER AnacondaBasePath
 This is an optional parameter and can be used to specify an already installed Anaconda3 installation.
 By default a version of Anaconda3 will be installed into [C:\local\Anaconda3-4.1.1-Windows-x86_64]

.EXAMPLE
 .\install.ps1
 
 Run the installer and see what operations would be performed
.EXAMPLE
 .\install.ps1 -Execute
 
 Run the installer and perform the installation operations
.EXAMPLE
 .\install.ps1 -Execute -AnacondaBasePath d:\cntkBeta

 This will install Anaconda in the [d:\cntkBeta] directory.
