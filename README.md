# CNTK

## Latest news
*2016-08-10.* CNTK now supports **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)**. Read more in the [corresponding article](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/GRUs-on-CNTK-with-BrainScript).

*2016-07-15.* V 1.6 Binary release  
CNTK v.1.6 binaries are on the [CNTK Releases page](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/releases)

*2016-07-12.* We have further expanded Licensing options for CNTK 1bit-SGD and related components. See the details at the [Wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/cntk/wiki/CNTK-1bit-SGD-License). These new options are an extension of the new CNTK 1bit-SGD License that we have announced on Jun 23, 2016.

*2016-07-05.* CNTK now supports *Deconvolution* and *Unpooling*. See the usage example in the Network number 4 in [MNIST Sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/master/Examples/Image/MNIST/README.md).

*2016-06-23.* New License Terms for CNTK 1bit-SGD and related components.  
Effective immediately the License Terms for CNTK 1bit-SGD and related components have changed. The new Terms provide more flexibility and enable new usage scenarios, especially in commercial environments. Read the new Terms at the [standard location](https://cntk1bitsgd.codeplex.com/license). Please note, that while the new Terms are significantly more flexible comparing to the previous ones, they are still **more restrictive** than the main CNTK License. Consequently everything described in [Enabling 1bit-SGD](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Enabling-1bit-SGD) section of the Wiki remains valid.

## What is CNTK
CNTK (http://www.cntk.ai/), the Computational Network Toolkit by Microsoft Research, is a unified deep-learning toolkit that describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph. In this directed graph, leaf nodes represent input values or network parameters, while other nodes represent matrix operations upon their inputs. CNTK allows to easily realize and combine popular model types such as feed-forward DNNs, convolutional nets (CNNs), and recurrent networks (RNNs/LSTMs). It implements stochastic gradient descent (SGD, error backpropagation) learning with automatic differentiation and parallelization across multiple GPUs and servers. CNTK has been available under an open-source license since April 2015. It is our hope that the community will take advantage of CNTK to share ideas more quickly through the exchange of open source working code.

## Performance

The figure below compares processing speed (frames processed per second) of CNTK to that of four other well-known toolkits. The configuration uses a fully connected 4-layer neural network (see our benchmark [scripts](https://github.com/Alexey-Kamenev/Benchmarks)) and an effective mini batch size (8192). All results were obtained on the same hardware with the respective latest public software versions as of Dec 3, 2015.
