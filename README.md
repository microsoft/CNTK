# What is The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit

The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/cognitive-toolkit/), is a unified deep-learning toolkit that describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph. In this directed graph, leaf nodes represent input values or network parameters, while other nodes represent matrix operations upon their inputs. CNTK allows to easily realize and combine popular model types such as feed-forward DNNs, convolutional nets (CNNs), and recurrent networks (RNNs/LSTMs). It implements stochastic gradient descent (SGD, error backpropagation) learning with automatic differentiation and parallelization across multiple GPUs and servers. CNTK has been available under an open-source license since April 2015. It is our hope that the community will take advantage of CNTK to share ideas more quickly through the exchange of open source working code.

## Performance

Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) provides significant performance gains compared to other toolkits [click here for details](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.07249.pdf). Here is a summary of findings by researchers at HKBU.

> * CNTKâ€™s LSTM performance is 5-10x faster than the other toolkits.
> * For convolution (image tasks), CNTK is comparable, but note the authors were using CNTK 1.7.2, and current CNTK 2.0 beta 10 is over 30% faster than 1.7.2.
> * For all networks, CNTK's performance was superior to TensorFlow performance.

Historically, CNTK has been a pioneer in optimizing performance on multi-GPU systems. We continue to maintain the edge ([NVidia news at SuperComputing 2016](http://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-microsoft-accelerate-ai-together) and [CRAY at NIPS 2016](https://www.onmsft.com/news/microsoft-and-cray-announce-partnership-to-speed-up-deep-learning-on-supercomputers)).

 CNTK was a pioneer in introducing scalability across multi-server multi-GPU systems. The figure below compares processing speed (frames processed per second) of CNTK to that of four other well-known toolkits. The configuration uses a fully connected 4-layer neural network (see our benchmark [scripts](https://github.com/Alexey-Kamenev/Benchmarks)) and an effective mini batch size (8192). All results were obtained on the same hardware with the respective latest public software versions as of Dec 3, 2015.
