# Grocery Dataset

The Grocery dataset is a small toy data set that contains images of food items in a fridge. 

The Grocery dataset is not included in the CNTK distribution but can be easily
downloaded by cd to this directory, Examples/Image/DataSets/Grocery and running the following Python command:

`python install_grocery.py`

After running the script, you will see three folders with images (positive, negative and test) and several text files that contain mappings and annotations. 

The grocery dataset is for example used in the Fast R-CNN object detection example, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/Object-Detection-using-Fast-R-CNN).
