# Animals Dataset

The Animals dataset is a small toy data set that contains license free images of mainly wolfs and sheep which were taken from the internet.

The Animals dataset is not included in the CNTK distribution but can be easily
downloaded by cd to this directory, Examples/Image/DataSets/Grocery and running the following Python command:

`python install_grocery.py`

After running the script, you will see two folders with images (Train and Test). 

The grocery dataset is for example used in the Transfer Learning example, see [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Build-your-own-image-classifier-using-Transfer-Learning).
