# CNTK Examples

The [Tutorials/](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/master/Tutorials/) and
[Examples/](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/master/Examples/) folders
contain variety of example configurations for CNTK networks using both the
Python API and BrainScript.
The examples are structured by topic into Image, Language Understanding,
Speech, and so forth. To get started with CNTK we recommend the tutorials in
the `Tutorials` folder.

An overview on all examples and tutorials is also provided by the
[Cognitive Toolkit Model Gallery](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/cognitive-toolkit/model-gallery/) page.
