                        // It expects "complex" Schemas to be defined separately and referenced. For this reason, you should only

                        // works well because it prevents the "implementation detail" of type namespaces from leaking into your
                        // Swagger docs and UI. However, if you have multiple types in your API with the same class name, you'll

                        // enum type. Swashbuckle will honor this change out-of-the-box. However, if you use a different
                        // approach to serialize enums as strings, you can also force Swashbuckle to describe them as strings.
