# This example demonstrates how to train a model, showcasing a range of training options: 
#  - checkpointing
#  - testing after each minibatch
#  - cross-validation based learning-rate control and early stopping in user code
#  - data-parallel distributed training using MPI
# This is shown along the task of recognizing handwritten digits on the MNIST corpus.
