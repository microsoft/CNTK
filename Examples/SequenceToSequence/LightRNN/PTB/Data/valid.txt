 the stock has fallen $ N or N N in the three trading days since announcement of the collapse of the $ 300-a-share takeover jolted the entire stock market into its <unk> plunge ever <eos>
 this is a total <unk> for takeover-stock traders one investment banker said <eos>
 los angeles financier marvin davis who put united in play with a $ N billion bid two months ago last night <unk> both a ray of hope and an extra element of uncertainty by saying he remains interested in acquiring ual <eos>

 yesterday 's selling began after a japanese news agency reported that japanese banks which balked at the first bid were ready to reject a revised version at around $ N a share or $ N billion <eos>
 several reports as the day <unk> gave vague or <unk> indications about whether banks would sign up <eos>
 citicorp for example said only that it had <unk> of interest of a transaction from both the borrowers and the banks but did n't have an agreement <eos>
 late in the day mr. wolf issued a <unk> statement calling mr. <unk> 's blast divisive and <unk> for <eos>
 but he gave few details on the progress toward a new bid saying only we are working toward a revised proposal for majority employee ownership <eos>

 in london british airways chairman lord king was quoted in the times as declaring he is not prepared to take my shareholders into a <unk> deal <eos>
 observers said it appeared that british air was angered at the way the bid has <unk> into confusion as well as by the banks ' effort to round up financing for what one called a deal that is n't a deal <eos>
 the effort to revive the bid was complicated by the <unk> nature of the <unk> buying group <eos>

 last week just before the bank commitments were due the union asked the u.s. labor department to study whether the bid violated legal standards of fairness governing employee investment funds <eos>

 right away you notice the following things about a philip glass concert <eos>
 it attracts people with funny hair or with no hair in front of me a girl with <unk> <unk> sat <unk> a boy who had <unk> his <eos>
 whoever constitute the local left bank come out in force dressed in black along with a <unk> of <unk> who want to be on the cutting edge <eos>
 people in glass houses tend to look <unk> <eos>
 and if still <unk> at the evening 's end you notice something else the audience at first <unk> and <unk> by the music releases its <unk> feelings in collective <unk> <eos>
 currently in the middle of a <unk> <unk> tour as a solo <unk> mr. glass has left behind his <unk> equipment and <unk> in favor of going it alone <eos>
 he sits down at the piano and plays <eos>
 and plays <eos>
 either one likes it or one does n't <eos>
 the typical glass audience which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers certainly does <eos>
 the work though sounds like <unk> for <unk> <eos>
 philip glass is the <unk> and his music the new clothes of the <unk> <eos>
 his success is easy to understand <eos>
 <unk> introducing and explaining his pieces mr. glass looks and sounds more like a <unk> <unk> describing his work than a classical <unk> playing a recital <eos>
 the piano <unk> which have been labeled <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> cyclical <unk> and <unk> are <unk> <unk> therefore <unk> <unk> <unk> therefore <unk> and <unk> <unk> but <unk> therefore both pretty and <unk> <eos>
 it is music for people who want to hear something different but do n't want to work especially hard at the task <eos>
 it is <unk> listening for the now generation <eos>
 mr. glass has <unk> the famous <unk> <unk> less is more <eos>
 his more is always less <eos>
 far from being <unk> the music <unk> <unk> us with apparent <unk> not so <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of N time <unk> <unk> and <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <eos>
 but the music has its <unk> and mr. glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex <eos>
 opening N from <unk> <unk> the audience to the glass technique never <unk> too far from the piano 's center mr. glass works in the two <unk> on either side of middle c and his fingers seldom leave the <unk> <eos>
 there is a <unk> musical style here but not a particular performance style <eos>
 the music is not especially <unk> indeed it 's hard to imagine a bad performance of it <eos>
 nothing <unk> no <unk> no <unk> <unk> problems challenge the performer <eos>
 we hear we may think inner voices but they all seem to be saying the same thing <eos>
 with planet news music meant to <unk> <unk> of allen <unk> 's wichita <unk> <unk> mr. glass gets going <eos>
 his hands sit <unk> apart on the <unk> <eos>
 seventh <unk> make you feel as though he may break into a very slow <unk> <unk> <eos>
 the <unk> <unk> but there is little <unk> even though his fingers begin to <unk> over more of the <unk> <eos>
 contrasts predictably <unk> first the music is loud then it becomes soft then you realize it becomes <unk> again <eos>
 the fourth <unk> play an <unk> from <unk> on the beach is like a <unk> but it does n't seem to move much beyond its <unk> ground in three blind mice <eos>
 when mr. glass decides to get really fancy he <unk> his hands and hits a <unk> bass note with his right hand <eos>
 he does this in at least three of his solo pieces <eos>
 you might call it a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> <eos>
 in mad rush which came from a commission to write a piece of <unk> length mr. glass <unk> and <unk> confessed that this was no problem for me an a <unk> with a b section several times before the piece ends <unk> <eos>
 not only is the typical <unk> <unk> it is also often multiple in its context s <eos>
 mad rush began its life as the <unk> to the <unk> lama 's first public address in the u.s. when mr. glass played it on the <unk> at new york 's <unk> of st. john the <unk> <eos>
 later it was performed on radio <unk> in germany and then <unk> <unk> took it for one of her dance pieces <eos>
 the point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything <eos>
 the evening ended with mr. glass 's <unk> another multiple work <eos>
 parts N N and N come from the <unk> of <unk> morris 's <unk> film the thin blue line and the two other parts from <unk> music to two separate <unk> of the <unk> story of the same name <eos>
 when used as background in this way the music has an appropriate <unk> as when a <unk> phrase a <unk> minor third <unk> the seemingly endless <unk> of reports interviews and <unk> of witnesses in the morris film <eos>
 served up as a solo however the music lacks the <unk> provided by a context within another medium <eos>
 <unk> of mr. glass may agree with the critic richard <unk> 's sense that the N music in twelve parts is as <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> <unk> <eos>
 but while making the obvious point that both <unk> develop variations from themes this comparison <unk> the intensely <unk> nature of mr. glass 's music <eos>
 its supposedly <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> that makes one <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> the <unk> radical <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and what in <unk> even seems like <unk> in <unk> <eos>
 mr. <unk> is professor of english at southern <unk> university and editor of the southwest review <eos>
 honeywell inc. said it hopes to complete shortly the first of two sales of shares in its japanese joint venture <unk> for about $ N million <eos>
 the company would n't disclose the buyer of the initial N N stake <eos>
 proceeds of the sale expected to be completed next week would be used to repurchase as many as N million shares of honeywell stock the company said <eos>
 honeywell said it is negotiating the sale of a second stake in <unk> but indicated it intends to hold at least N N of the joint venture 's stock long term <eos>
 a N N stake would allow honeywell to include <unk> earnings in its results <eos>
 honeywell previously said it intended to reduce its holding in the japanese concern as part of a restructuring plan which also calls for a reduction of <unk> on weapons sales <eos>
 yesterday a spokeswoman said the company was pleased with our progress in that regard and hopes to provide additional details soon <eos>
 honeywell said its defense and marine systems group incurred delays in shipping some undisclosed contracts during the third quarter resulting in lower operating profit for that business <eos>
 overall honeywell reported earnings of $ N million or $ N a share for the three months ended oct. N compared with a loss of $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier <eos>
 the previous period 's results included a $ N million pretax charge related to <unk> contract costs and a $ N million pretax gain on real estate sales <eos>
 sales for the latest quarter were flat at $ N billion <eos>
 for the nine months honeywell reported earnings of $ N million or $ N a share compared with earnings of $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier <eos>

 once again your editorial page <unk> the law to conform to your almost <unk> <unk> <eos>
 in an <unk> of little <unk> to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups michael s. <unk> <unk> your readers the clean water act is written upon the <unk> the <unk> rather that nothing but zero risk will do it <unk> a legal standard of zero <unk> <unk> environmental <unk> sept. N <eos>
 this statement surely <unk> your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive but it is simply wrong <eos>
 the clean water act contains no legal standard of zero <unk> <eos>
 it requires that <unk> of <unk> into the waters of the united states be authorized by permits that reflect the <unk> limitations developed under section N <eos>
 whatever may be the problems with this system it <unk> reflects zero risk or zero <unk> <eos>
 perhaps mr. <unk> was confused by congress 's <unk> statement of the national goal in section N which indeed calls for the elimination of <unk> by N no less <eos>
 this <unk> statement was not taken seriously when enacted in N and should not now be confused with the <unk> provisions of the statute <eos>
 thus you do the public a great <unk> when mr. <unk> suggests even <unk> that the clean water act prohibits the preparation of a <unk> and water your <unk> readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them as they <unk> in the night with their <unk> and waters from the <unk> knock of the sierra club at their doors <eos>
 robert j. <unk> <eos>
 national geographic the <unk> u.s. magazine is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy <unk> pages that upscale advertisers love <eos>
 so why did advertising pages plunge by almost N N and ad revenue by N N in the first half <eos>
 to hear advertisers tell it the magazine just has n't kept up with the times <eos>
 despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the third world it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to <unk> through in search of <unk> tribe women <eos>
 worse it lagged behind competitors in offering <unk> <unk> from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers <eos>
 but now the magazine is attempting to fight back with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign <eos>
 advertisers do n't think of the magazine first says joan <unk> who joined in april as national advertising director <eos>
 what we want to do is take a more aggressive stance <eos>
 people did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace and in many ways we were n't <eos>
 the <unk> magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much <unk> before <eos>
 it largely <unk> on its <unk> <unk> N million subscribers in the first half up from N million a year ago an average age of N for readers at the <unk> of their <unk> years loyalty to the tune of an N N average subscription renewal rate <eos>
 the magazine had its best year yet in N when it <unk> its centennial and racked up a N N gain in ad pages to N <eos>
 but this year when the <unk> surrounding its centennial died so too did some advertiser interest <eos>
 the reason ad executives say is that the entire magazine business has been soft and national geographic has some <unk> that make it especially <unk> during a soft market <eos>
 perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices $ N for a <unk> page vs. $ N for the <unk> a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation <eos>
 when ad dollars are tight the high page cost is a major <unk> for advertisers who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all <eos>
 even though national geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like <unk> the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency says harry glass new york media manager for bozell inc <eos>
 to combat that problem national geographic like other magazines began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines for example ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest N markets <eos>
 but the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors <eos>
 time magazine for example has more than N separate editions going to different regions top management and other groups <eos>
 another sticking point for advertisers was national geographic 's tradition of <unk> its ads together usually at the beginning or end of the magazine rather than spreading ads out among its articles as most magazines do <eos>
 and national geographic 's <unk> size means extra production costs for advertisers <eos>
 but ms. <unk> says the magazine is fighting back <eos>
 it now offers N regional editions it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles and it has been <unk> up its sales force <eos>
 and it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives marketing directors and media executives just that <eos>
 the centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign into which the magazine will pour about $ N mostly in the next few weeks <eos>
 the campaign created by <unk> group 's ddb needham agency takes advantage of the <unk> photography that national geographic is known for <eos>
 in one ad a photo of the interior of the <unk> in paris is <unk> with the headline the only book more respected than <unk> does n't accept advertising <eos>
 another ad pictures a tree <unk> magnified N times with the headline for impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions <eos>
 ms. <unk> says she wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in N categories including corporate financial services consumer electronics insurance and food <eos>
 her goal to top N ad pages in N up from about N this year <eos>
 whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain <eos>
 the ad campaign is meant to <unk> the thought of national geographic she says <eos>
 we want it to be a <unk> kind of image <eos>

 the commodity futures trading commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges a move almost certain to <unk> exchange officials and traders <eos>
 the cftc said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites problems associated with the practice <eos>
 dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers <eos>
 the issue exploded this year after a federal bureau of investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange <eos>
 while not specifically mentioned in the fbi charges dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations <eos>
 critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders <eos>
 traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders <eos>
 the exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand <eos>
 the exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for <unk> traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration <eos>
 the cftc may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions <eos>
 the agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them <eos>
 wendy <unk> the agency 's chairman told the senate agriculture committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by <unk> <eos>
 the study by the cftc 's division of economic analysis shows that a trade is a trade a member of the study team said <eos>
 whether a trade is done on a dual or <unk> basis the member said does n't seem to have much economic impact <eos>
 currently most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts which makes them brokers or for their own accounts as <unk> <unk> <eos>
 the tests indicate that dual and <unk> traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market mrs. <unk> told the senate panel <eos>
 members of congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to <unk> cftc operations <eos>
 the house 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of N contracts or more <unk> those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system <eos>
 the senate bill would force the cftc to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect <unk> abuses <eos>
 so far one test of restricting dual trading has worked well <eos>
 the chicago merc banned dual trading in its standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in N <eos>
 under the rules traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers <eos>
 traders who stand on the pit 's top step where most customer orders are executed ca n't trade for themselves <eos>
 a merc spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit <eos>
 it 's too soon to tell but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it he said <eos>
 he said he would n't comment on the cftc plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal <eos>
 but at a meeting last week tom <unk> the board of trade 's president told commodity lawyers dual trading is definitely worth saving <eos>
 it adds something to the market <eos>
 japanese firms push <unk> car <unk> <eos>
 japanese luxury-car makers are trying to set strict design standards for their dealerships <eos>
 but some dealers are negotiating <unk> terms while others decline to deal at all <eos>
 nissan motor co. 's infiniti division likes to insist that every dealer construct and <unk> a building in a japanese style <eos>
 specifications include a <unk> <unk> <unk> at the center of each showroom and a <unk> bridge <unk> a stream that flows into the building from outside <eos>
 infiniti has it down to the <unk> says jay <unk> a partner at <unk> power & associates an auto research firm <eos>
 toyota motor corp. 's lexus division also provides specifications <eos>
 but only two-thirds of lexus dealers are <unk> new buildings according to the lexus <unk> <eos>
 some are even coming up with their own novel designs <eos>
 in louisville ky. for example david peterson has built a lexus dealership with the showroom on the second floor <eos>
 yet some dealers have turned down infiniti or lexus <unk> because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements <eos>
 lee seidman of cleveland says infiniti was a bear on <unk> but at least let him <unk> an existing building without the stream <eos>
 mr. seidman says he turned down a lexus franchise in part because the building was <unk> but very expensive <eos>
 to head off arguments infiniti offers dealers cash bonuses and <unk> construction loans <eos>
 <unk> device 's <unk> plays back a lesson <eos>
 products <unk> have to be first to be winners <eos>
 that 's the lesson offered through one case study featured in a design exhibit <eos>
 dictaphone corp. was caught off guard in N when its main competitor <unk> office products of japan introduced a <unk> <unk> recorder half the size of standard <unk> devices <eos>
 blocked by patent protection from following suit dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the <unk> in half again down to the length of a <unk> <eos>
 by N designers and engineers at dictaphone a pitney bowes subsidiary had produced a working model of a <unk> recorder <eos>
 by N however the patent status of the <unk> <unk> had changed permitting dictaphone to develop its own competitive micro system which it did <eos>
 marketing and sales departments then urged <unk> of the <unk> project <eos>
 but others said <unk> should proceed <eos>
 both were right <eos>
 dictaphone went ahead and introduced the <unk> in N but it has n't sold well <eos>
 to date says <unk> <unk> a dictaphone vice president it has broken even or shown a small loss <eos>
 nevertheless the device has been successful in other ways <eos>
 it helped dictaphone attract better engineers and it provided new technology for other company products <eos>
 the <unk> recorder also helped transform the company 's reputation from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <eos>
 it gave me great pride to see the inventor of the <unk> in japan look at the <unk> and shake his head and say <unk> says mr. <unk> <eos>
 dictaphone 's <unk> recorder is one of N case studies in the <unk> design project sponsored by the design management institute of boston and harvard business school <eos>
 the studies are on exhibit at harvard this month and will travel to chicago 's institute of design and the university of california at berkeley <eos>
 a rake 's progress means <unk> out <eos>
 one day carl barrett of mobile ala. was <unk> some <unk> leaves but the rake kept riding up over the <unk> <eos>
 the harder he tried to push them into large <unk> the closer he came to breaking the rake and <unk> his back <eos>
 so mr. barrett then vice president of the alabama <unk> association took a <unk> garden rake and taped it to the <unk> of a <unk> rake about nine inches up <eos>
 his crude device worked the lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile while the higher harder teeth moved the top of the pile <eos>
 now incorporated into a <unk> rake the <unk> <unk> or <unk> also are supposed to aid in picking up leaves <eos>
 one customer donald <unk> of mobile says the barrett rake allowed him to do his lawn in N N hours two hours less than usual <eos>
 but other rake makers have their doubts <eos>
 richard mason president of <unk> co. in <unk> w. va. says the barrett rake makes sense but it would be tough to explain to consumers <eos>
 john <unk> marketing director for true <unk> corp. a subsidiary of black & decker says people do n't want to move a <unk> pile <eos>
 they either pick it up he says or they start pulling from a fresh direction <eos>
 odds and ends <eos>

 the pentagon is a <unk> house <eos>
 living there for six years was really scary <eos>
 the ghosts of the past are everywhere they are kept at bay only by feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget <eos>
 some can be bought off relatively <unk> <eos>
 during the korean war gen. douglas <unk> demanded and got in addition to his u.n. command in korea his own naval command in japan <unk> <eos>
 those <unk> operations cost less than $ N billion a year and keep mac 's ghost quiet <eos>
 that 's about all it costs to <unk> adm. erich <unk> 's ghost <eos>
 in N <unk> and the german navy threatened to attack the panama <unk> so we created the southern command in panama <eos>
 the southern command has grown even bigger since the war because <unk> 's ghost sometimes runs through the e ring dressed like gen. noriega <eos>
 the command 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against gen. noriega meet the war powers act 's six points cap <unk> 's seven points the intelligence committee 's N points and <unk> wilson 's N points necessary to justify u.s. support <eos>
 so far no one has <eos>
 the ghost of the soviet <unk> discovered in cuba back in the <unk> costs just a few hundred million the price of the caribbean command in key west that president carter created in N <eos>
 the <unk> has n't been heard from since but we keep the staff around just in case <eos>
 george marshall 's ghost is much more difficult to keep happy <eos>
 we keep a lot of <unk> to him around the pentagon <unk> <unk> <unk> and such <eos>
 the army headquarters on the third deck of the pentagon used to <unk> a lot of <unk> to him but the navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it <eos>
 you see marshall had this thing about the navy and the <unk> he wanted to make them part of the army but secretary of the navy james <unk> blocked him <eos>
 now his ghost wo n't let up till it 's done <eos>
 to keep him quiet we <unk> a new unified command every year or so run by the army or the air force and put more of the navy and <unk> under it <eos>
 but we still hear him <unk> at night because the navy has a few ships left and to satisfy him the navy 's sea lift forces were given to a new air force bureaucracy in illinois its space operations to another command in colorado the <unk> to a new army bureaucracy in fort <unk> and the navy 's indian ocean and persian gulf forces to an army bureaucracy in florida <eos>
 which brings up the worst and <unk> ghost of all the ghost of the shah of iran <eos>
 when the shah died president carter was so scared that the shah 's ghost would blame him for <unk> him out to make way for the <unk> that he declared the carter doctrine <eos>
 mr. carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab iran <eos>
 but that ghost would n't settle for words he wanted money and people lots <eos>
 so mr. carter formed three new army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in tampa called the rapid <unk> force <eos>
 but that ghost was n't <unk> he knew the <unk> was neither rapid nor <unk> nor a force even though it cost $ N billion or $ N billion a year <eos>
 after mr. carter was defeated in N the shah 's ghost claimed the credit and then went after president reagan and cap <unk> <eos>
 i saw what he did to them <unk> <eos>
 it made my <unk> dance with <unk> <eos>
 why he used to lay in wait for cap suddenly he 'd leap from behind some <unk> of marshall onto cap 's <unk> and grab him by the <unk> and <unk> him till he <unk> up an additional $ N billion or so <eos>
 cap added four more divisions to the army two active and two reserve two carrier groups to the navy a division equivalent to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and a thousand tactical aircraft to the air force <eos>
 he bought $ N billion in <unk> ships and $ N billion in <unk> and equipment to fill them and <unk> them at a new $ N billion base at diego garcia in the middle of the indian ocean <eos>
 he dedicated all these new forces to the persian gulf <eos>
 one night both marshall 's ghost and the shah 's ghost together caught cap and threw him to the ground <eos>
 before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the <unk> in tampa and renamed it central command <eos>
 he gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the persian gulf and indian ocean <eos>
 marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers someday maybe they would get the whole navy <eos>
 they had fun moving the carriers around but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine <unk> <eos>
 but the shah still kept leaping out at cap so cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ N billion of <unk> <unk> <unk> etc. in order that those seven new army divisions and three marine <unk> could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the <unk> <unk> <eos>
 then suddenly <unk> 's ghost came to visit and said what the hell are you doing planning for a land war in asia N miles away <eos>
 we 'd get our <unk> kicked <eos>
 lucky for cap <unk> was <unk> and soon went away while the shah he kept coming back <eos>
 so the u.s. found itself paying about $ N billion in <unk> to various arab <unk> for <unk> rights around the indian ocean <eos>
 we had great success in somalia <eos>
 but then it turned out that president <unk> <unk> was not at all a nice person and the navy pointed out that the base he promised us in <unk> had <unk> up about a hundred years ago and anyway was N miles from the mouth of the gulf <eos>
 but who 's counting <eos>
 still <unk> was the best we could get so we stay in bed with president <unk> <eos>
 all these reports about him committing <unk> are probably <unk> anyway <eos>
 but would n't you know now that we are spending <unk> of dollars and have built those new divisions and new air wings and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the russians in iran the russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject <eos>
 meanwhile congress is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget <eos>
 predictably some navy guys said do we still need to keep all N army divisions on active duty and all those extra <unk> aircraft without bases and all those army guys playing <unk> in tampa <eos>
 could n't we save $ N billion or $ N billion a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves <eos>
 and why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by <unk> central command and putting responsibility for gulf naval operations back where it belongs afloat with the task force <unk> in the gulf <eos>
 and where were all our <unk> paid indian ocean allies last year when our <unk> were being attacked <eos>
 questions like that really stir up marshall 's ghost <eos>
 he appeared late one night in the <unk> of the new defense secretary dick cheney <eos>
 marshall came <unk> in like <unk> 's ghost dragging those chains of <unk> and air wings and links with arab <unk> <eos>
 he would n't leave until mr. cheney promised to do whatever the pentagon systems analysts told him <eos>
 so next day mr. cheney went out and did just that he canceled the <unk> navy and cut back one carrier and N <unk> <eos>
 then he canceled production of the navy 's most important carrier aircraft the f-14 and the <unk> <eos>
 on the other hand mr. cheney retained all those new land forces <eos>
 marshall 's ghost is satisfied for now but he 'll be back <eos>
 what with halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming more and more pentagon bureaucrats are <unk> under their desks <eos>
 they know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships <eos>
 then the whole thing will start to collapse just as it did in the 1970s and the ghosts and <unk> will be <unk> through the place turning people 's hair white <eos>
 gives me the <unk> just thinking about it <eos>
 mr. lehman a reagan navy secretary is a managing director of painewebber <eos>
 the metal and marble lobby of centrust bank 's headquarters is <unk> than your average savings and loan <eos>
 for one thing there is an old master on the wall samuel <unk> david a big <unk> <unk> painted by <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <eos>
 at the moment however the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have <unk> centrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive david l. paul <eos>
 in an international buying spree that began barely two years ago mr. paul <unk> a collection of about N <unk> works including the <unk> at a total cost of $ N million <eos>
 by midnight oct. N all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off under orders from florida 's comptroller whose office <unk> the state 's s&ls <eos>
 centrust did n't meet the deadline <eos>
 the collection was at the heart of a <unk> plan mr. paul had in which the art was to do double duty as an investment for centrust and as <unk> for the s&l 's new office tower designed by <unk> <unk> <eos>
 the <unk> is that the $ N million was <unk> from the funds of this federally insured institution even as centrust was losing money hand over <unk> <eos>
 mr. paul had no right to buy art for the s&l in the first place it is n't on the comptroller 's permissible list without seeking a special <unk> which he did not do <eos>
 besides that some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of centrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman 's estate on la <unk> <unk> off miami beach <eos>
 last spring the comptroller 's office called a halt to mr. paul 's <unk> giving him six months to sell the paintings <eos>
 the acquisitions officials said in a letter to mr. paul were <unk> <unk> and unauthorized <eos>
 so far mr. paul has <unk> but three of his <unk> he wo n't say to whom <eos>
 the comptroller 's office says it is monitoring the situation <eos>
 though the agency could remove mr. paul it has no current intention to do that <eos>
 it 's not like selling <unk> mr. paul says as he takes a drag on a <unk> st. <unk> cigarette <eos>
 the last six months has established the quality of the collection <eos>
 there 's no fire sale here <eos>
 despite mr. paul 's characteristic <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> is finding that getting centrust florida 's largest thrift institution out of its <unk> investments is much tougher than getting into them had been <eos>
 paintings are just part of the picture <eos>
 although mr. paul has <unk> a $ N billion junk-bond portfolio to less than $ N million since april the high-yield debt market has plummeted <eos>
 <unk> itself of what is left as is required of all thrift institutions by july N under the new federal s&l bailout law may well prove difficult <eos>
 and centrust has other problems <eos>
 late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock a move that suggests deep concern about an institution <eos>
 mr. paul has a plan to bring in $ N million by selling off N of centrust 's N branches but it has yet to be approved by regulators <eos>
 it is mr. paul 's art venture however that has drawn the most attention from investors and regulators not to mention <unk> throughout the world <eos>
 <unk> shareholders some of whom are suing say the chairman and his collection <unk> the excesses of speculation that set off the national s&l crisis <eos>
 centrust shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of $ N in N to close yesterday at $ N <eos>
 gallery directors meanwhile say mr. paul and others of his <unk> have left an <unk> mark on the art world and not for the better <eos>
 collectors do n't say it 's a van <unk> anymore <unk> harry brooks the president of <unk> & co. a new york gallery <eos>
 they say <unk> <unk> got $ N million for his so certainly $ N million is n't too much for mine <eos>
 the great collectors we depended on such as paul mellon or norton simon have stopped buying and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting <eos>
 mr. <unk> an art dealer and <unk> sold vincent van <unk> 's <unk> at a sotheby 's auction in november N to australian businessman alan bond <eos>
 trouble is mr. bond has yet to pay up and until he does sotheby 's has the painting under lock and key <eos>
 when mr. paul moved in on the art market he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly to be considered by centrust <eos>
 he established his reputation as a <unk> in january last year at sotheby 's auction of the linda and gerald guterman collection in new york <eos>
 there on one of his first shopping trips mr. paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices <eos>
 he paid $ N million for instance for a still life by jan <unk> <unk> <unk> that was expected to fetch perhaps $ N <eos>
 the price paid was a record for the artist <eos>
 some N N of items offered at the guterman auction were sold at an average price of $ N <eos>
 the rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids <eos>
 afterward mr. paul is said by mr. guterman to have <unk> mr. guterman the new york developer selling the collection and <unk> <eos>
 he says he <unk> them recalls mr. guterman <eos>
 and he tells me if you want to see your paintings you 'll have to come to my house in florida <eos>
 mr. paul denies <unk> and <unk> <eos>
 it 's just not true he says <eos>
 mr. paul quickly became more aggressive in his collecting with the help of george wachter a sotheby 's expert in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the guterman items <eos>
 mr. wachter who became his principal adviser searched <unk> in london paris and <unk> <eos>
 and according to one dealer mr. wachter had a <unk> for introducing mr. paul with the phrase he can buy anything <eos>
 nicholas hall the president of the <unk> u.s.a. ltd. gallery in new york sold mr. paul <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> by giovanni <unk> <unk> <eos>
 mr. hall says mr. paul was known to spend a lot of money <eos>
 people were interested in seeing him but it was recognized that the route was through sotheby 's and particularly george wachter <eos>
 mr. paul thus developed a close <unk> relationship with sotheby 's <eos>
 mr. paul was eager to <unk> a collection for the headquarters centrust has been moving into for the greater part of a year <eos>
 sotheby 's the auction house founded in london N and now under the <unk> of sotheby 's holdings inc. was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it <unk> to build its u.s. business <eos>
 european dealers continued to dominate the action in old masters which sotheby 's north america had lately been touting in this country <eos>
 for several months there was optimism all around <eos>
 last october mr. paul paid out $ N million of centrust 's cash plus a $ N million commission for portrait of a man as <unk> <eos>
 the painting attributed to <unk> artist peter paul rubens was purchased privately through sotheby 's not at auction <eos>
 in march N just N months into his campaign mr. paul was named by art & <unk> magazine as one of the top N individual collectors in the u.s. <eos>
 an unknown quantity to most of the art world paul is no <unk> to <unk> spending the magazine said noting that he does n't stop at <unk> on <unk> but also spends big on art you can eat <eos>
 he recently bid $ N at a paris charity auction for a dinner <unk> by six of the world 's great chefs but the final party cost closer to $ N <eos>
 mr. paul says it was n't that high <eos>
 the art collection might have come to rival the <unk> ' had the florida comptroller 's office not got wind of mr. paul 's <unk> <unk> <eos>
 in its letter to him dated march N and shared with reporters alex <unk> the chief of the <unk> bureau in the comptroller 's office expressed <unk> that the s&l could be so <unk> when it had reported losses of more than $ N million in its two preceding quarters <eos>
 the state gave centrust N days to sell the rubens <eos>
 the comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but <unk> its demands ordering that the book value of the collection be reduced to zero <eos>
 in other words get rid of all the pictures <eos>
 the state <unk> noted that <unk> banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the <unk> to mr. paul govern yourself <unk> <eos>
 the state agency was particularly <unk> to learn that the rubens and a <unk> other paintings listed among the bank 's furniture and <unk> were actually hanging in the chairman 's house <eos>
 mr. paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at sotheby 's <eos>
 he explains that he was merely <unk> the paintings at home with some display because of the special <unk> environment required for their <unk> until centrust 's new building was ready for them <eos>
 still the incident was embarrassing <eos>
 it came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that mr. paul has benefited <unk> from his association with centrust <eos>
 for instance he got a $ N million loan from the s&l negotiated at a <unk> rate <eos>
 he owns N N of centrust 's shares <eos>
 adding to mr. paul 's problems dealers some with vested interests insist that he relying rather too heavily on sotheby 's advice paid much too much for several pieces in the centrust collection <eos>
 the $ N million <unk> on the rubens for example was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value given a dispute among scholars about its <unk> <eos>
 david <unk> the president of david <unk> inc. a new york gallery says scholars question the <unk> of the rubens <eos>
 it may have been painted instead by a rubens associate <eos>
 the feeling among many experts on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event mr. <unk> says <eos>
 it sounds like with the rubens he got absolutely taken to the <unk> <eos>
 victor <unk> the executive director of the <unk> association of america agrees that mr. paul paid very <unk> for the rubens and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat <eos>
 it 's not beyond credibility the rubens will someday be worth $ N million but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen <eos>
 still predicting is tricky <eos>
 i 'm forever <unk> by what i see making these high prices <eos>
 jonathan h. <unk> the son of the painting 's former owner mrs. rush <unk> <unk> the price talk as sour <unk> <eos>
 dealers <unk> of the purchase price he says were themselves interested in buying the rubens but lost out <eos>
 mr. paul for his part <unk> the rubens price saying a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself <eos>
 most of them were n't even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly he says <eos>
 art prices are <unk> but a good deal of <unk> is involved in <unk> statistics on sales <eos>
 salomon brothers inc. the investment-banking firm in its annual tally of investment returns reported that old masters <unk> N N in the year ended june N the greatest return of any of N assets it tracked <eos>
 <unk> and modern paintings not tracked by salomon are ranked even higher at N N by sotheby 's <eos>
 salomon moreover gets its data on art appreciation from sotheby 's whose prices go up with clients like mr. paul in its <unk> <eos>
 the <unk> <unk> from consideration the many paintings that go <unk> at auction <eos>
 art indexes track winners not losers <eos>
 but art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale <eos>
 also at any of sotheby 's auctions of old masters roughly one-third to <unk> of what is offered does n't sell at any price <eos>
 it 's not that there are n't any bids but the bids do n't meet the minimum reserve prices set by the sellers <eos>
 in january the <unk> painting that now hangs at centrust was expected to bring no more than $ N at auction until mr. paul came along with his $ N million <eos>
 mr. hall of the <unk> gallery says $ N million would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a <unk> four years ago <eos>
 but from his <unk> point it is n't that mr. paul a customer of his too <unk> for the work a <unk> painting by an artist who is not a household word <eos>
 the painting is N feet wide seven feet high <eos>
 rather it just shows things have changed <eos>
 mr. paul boasts that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn <eos>
 they went up N N last year and they 'll do it again this year he declares <eos>
 they were a <unk> <eos>
 everybody was out buying <unk> <eos>
 sotheby 's vice president <unk> <unk> says the auction house has been <unk> mr. paul in selling the paintings <eos>
 and while sotheby 's chief rivals in the art world private art dealers wo n't be happy to hear it she adds a number of the <unk> have already been sold and at a substantial profit <eos>
 mr. paul claims to have sold three paintings at more than a N N profit <eos>
 that is n't N N and the claim is n't <unk> <eos>
 he furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on sotheby 's or mr. wachter <eos>
 mr. paul says he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid <unk> <eos>
 after all he had the counsel of <unk> from the most reputable <unk> in the world <eos>
 he says he expects to sell the collection including the controversial rubens carefully and <unk> just as it was put together <eos>
 but in <unk> <unk> mr. paul 's holdings are <unk> <eos>
 that is he is being <unk> to put them on the market too soon and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works <eos>
 after a few years you can argue there has been natural appreciation says susan <unk> the publisher of leonard 's annual price index of art auctions <eos>
 but quick turnover in <unk> is like <unk> your jewelry you end up with N N <eos>
 people hold out and try to get a bargain <eos>
 sotheby 's <unk> itself and mr. paul in the matter <eos>
 mr. wachter says mr. paul was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment <eos>
 on occasion he paid a high price mr. wachter concedes but he says those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the paintings to <unk> them at a profit to collectors <eos>
 <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> at <unk> associates in san francisco considers it <unk> conflict of interest for an auction house to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased <eos>
 sotheby 's she says is wearing both hats <eos>
 i ca n't see why there would be a conflict of interest says sotheby 's ms. <unk> <eos>
 estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be <eos>
 frequently clients express interest in paintings but do n't end up bidding she adds so we do n't know who the potential buyer will be <eos>
 mr. paul in selling off his paintings is seeking at least a N N return on the bank 's investment so as to prove that the venture was sound <eos>
 mr. paul says that he has <unk> out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as japan and italy have examined the collection <eos>
 because of the pressure on centrust to sell dealers and collectors have been trying to get the paintings at <unk> prices <eos>
 but so far mr. paul and his advisers are holding fast <eos>
 one dealer martin <unk> of french & co. in new york says he would have loved to buy a jan <unk> de <unk> painting from the bank <eos>
 i tried to steal the picture to buy it <unk> and sotheby 's would n't do it <eos>
 they were protecting his interests <eos>
 meanwhile mr. paul and centrust executives are getting <unk> about <unk> <eos>
 mr. paul has been characterized as the great <unk> or something complains karen e. <unk> an executive vice president of centrust <eos>
 the media she says have distorted his personal life <eos>

 the turmoil on wall street may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy-outs of their specialty and department-store chains investment bankers and retailers said <eos>
 managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they intend to bid for their companies <eos>
 the chains include bloomingdale 's owned by campeau corp. toronto saks fifth avenue and marshall field 's owned by b.a.t industries plc london and b. altman & co. and <unk> inc. owned by hooker corp. which is now being managed by a court-appointed provisional <unk> <eos>
 hooker is based in sydney australia <eos>
 the combination of so many chains available for sale the recent failures of such retailing lbo 's as miller & <unk> inc. and declining investor confidence will drive down prices retailing observers said <eos>
 the pricing will become more realistic which should help management said bruce rosenthal a new york investment banker with nathan s. <unk> & co <eos>
 investors are n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed lbos but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense either <eos>
 earlier this year bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales mr. rosenthal added <eos>
 those days are over now he believes <eos>
 competition from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue added mr. rosenthal <eos>
 but when prices were crazy it was even harder to do an lbo <eos>
 bankers believed in the <unk> theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more <eos>
 this is no longer true today <eos>
 at saks fifth avenue paul <unk> senior vice president marketing agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed lbo <eos>
 having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage said mr. <unk> <eos>
 it would also help us in our search for equity partners <eos>
 to make an lbo work now we are going to need more than just junk bonds <eos>
 none believe the proposed management lbos will be easy to complete especially at b. altman & co. which is under chapter N bankruptcy protection <eos>
 not only could the wall street gyrations damp christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger <unk> and greater management equity participation <eos>
 further many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be <unk> to consider additional retailing investments <eos>
 it 's called bad money driving out good money said one retailing <unk> <eos>
 institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned <eos>
 however the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt <eos>
 in addition the fall selling season has generally been a good one especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues <eos>
 what 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings not liquidation values said joseph e. brooks chairman and chief executive officer of ann taylor inc. a specialty chain <eos>
 retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies <eos>
 still most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing lbos will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds a market already in <unk> in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the federated and allied units of campeau <eos>
 prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week which will help management said <unk> harrison chairman of <unk> inc. an investment-banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions <eos>
 but the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved <eos>
 potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management or insist the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past <eos>

 a federal appeals court struck down a natural-gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers part of $ N billion in costs from controversial <unk> contracts <eos>
 the court in a N ruling threw out a deadline set by the federal energy regulatory commission for settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved but did n't use <eos>
 ferc 's regulation had given pipelines until march N N to pass on to customers as much as N N of the costs of buying out their broken contracts which were made with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short <eos>
 a majority of old contracts were <unk> by the deadline and settled at steep discounts <eos>
 but pipeline companies estimate they still face $ N billion in liabilities from <unk> disputes including $ N billion they fear they wo n't be able to pass on to customers <eos>
 according to industry lawyers the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism <eos>
 the court left open whether ferc could <unk> a new deadline later <eos>
 the court agreeing with pipeline companies found the march N deadline was <unk> and <unk> and highly <unk> to the bargaining power of pipelines that were forced to negotiate settlement of the old <unk> contracts to meet the deadline <eos>
 a report last month by the interstate natural gas association of america found that pipelines ' settlement costs had jumped in the three months before the deadline to N cents on the dollar from N cents on the dollar in N <eos>
 the court ordered ferc to justify within N days not only its cost-sharing deadline but other major elements of its proposed regulation for introducing more competition into natural-gas transportation <eos>
 the court also questioned a <unk> mechanism that could be used to resolve <unk> liabilities <eos>
 the complex regulation known in the industry as order N has been <unk> contested by all sides including natural-gas producers pipelines local distribution companies and consumers <eos>
 the court 's decision would allow ferc to change some of its provisions but <unk> it will be reviewed again quickly by the court <eos>

 fidelity investments the nation 's largest fund company said phone volume was more than double its typical level but still half that of oct. N N <eos>
 net outflows from fidelity 's stock funds stood at less than $ N million or below N N of the $ N billion cash position of the firm 's stock portfolios <eos>
 much of the money was switched into the firm 's money market funds <eos>
 outflows since the close of trading friday remain below one-third their level of two years ago fidelity said <eos>
 other mutual fund companies reported even lighter withdrawal requests <eos>
 and some investors at fidelity and elsewhere even began buying stock funds during the day <eos>
 two years ago there was a lot of redemption activity and trouble with people getting through on the phone said <unk> <unk> head of the investment management division of the securities and exchange commission <eos>
 this time we do n't have that at all <eos>
 of course the relative calm could be jolted if the market <unk> again <eos>
 and any strong surge in redemptions could force some funds to dump stocks to raise cash as some did during black monday <eos>
 but funds generally are better prepared this time around <eos>
 as a group their cash position of N N of assets in august the latest figure available is N N higher than two years earlier <eos>
 many fund managers have boosted their cash levels in recent weeks <eos>
 the biggest flurry of investor activity came early in the day <eos>
 vanguard group inc. saw heavy exchanges from stock funds into money market funds after the telephone lines opened at N a.m <eos>
 in the first hour the real nervous folks came along a spokesman said <eos>
 but the <unk> pace of call volume in the first half-hour slowed considerably <eos>
 at <unk> stevens & clark inc. phone calls came in at N N more than the normal pace through early afternoon <eos>
 most of that increase came in the first hour after the phone lines opened at N a.m <eos>
 as stocks rose in fact some investors changed course and reversed their sell orders <eos>
 many funds allow investors to <unk> orders before the close of trading <eos>
 at <unk> and at the smaller ivy funds group in <unk> mass. for instance some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds but later called back to reverse the switches <eos>
 because mutual fund trades do n't take effect until the market close in this case at N p.m. these shareholders effectively stayed put <eos>
 at fidelity 's office in downtown boston gerald sherman walked in shortly after N a.m. and placed an order to switch his retirement accounts out of three stock funds and into a money market fund <eos>
 but by N p.m. with the market <unk> ahead for the day mr. sherman was preparing to undo his switch <eos>
 it 's a nice feeling to know that things stabilized said mr. sherman the <unk> <unk> of a discount department store <eos>
 but some investors continued to switch out of high-risk high-yield junk funds despite yesterday 's rebound from that market 's recent price declines <eos>
 shareholders have been steadily <unk> out of several big junk funds the past several weeks as the $ N billion market was jolted by a cash crunch at campeau corp. and steadily declining prices <eos>
 much of the money has been switched into money market funds fund executives say <eos>
 instead of selling bonds to meet redemptions however some funds have borrowed from banks to meet withdrawal requests <eos>
 this <unk> knocking down prices further <eos>
 the $ N billion t. rowe price high yield fund was among the funds that borrowed during the campeau crisis says george j. collins president of t. rowe price associates inc <eos>
 that way mr. collins says we did n't have to sell securities in a sloppy market <eos>
 when the market stabilized he added the firm sold the bonds and quickly paid the loans back <eos>

 the roller-coaster stock market is making life tougher for small companies trying to raise money <eos>
 in the wake of friday 's plunge and yesterday 's rebound some companies are already <unk> deals and others wish they could <eos>
 as in other jittery times many small businesses expect a particularly rough time raising funds as investors <unk> risky deals seeking safety in bigger companies <eos>
 even if stock prices fully recover from friday 's sharp decline the unsettled conditions will <unk> many investors <eos>
 the implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically says henry <unk> jr. chairman of <unk> corp. a four-year-old biotechnology company that is planning a private placement of stock <eos>
 the more <unk> that indicate risk the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain <eos>
 earlier this month <unk> inc. a <unk> mass. <unk> <unk> said it would accelerate expansion plans nationwide and offer more of its stock to the public <eos>
 at the time its shares were selling above their initial offering price of $ N and bankers believed <unk> would sell new stock without a <unk> <eos>
 but with the company 's shares standing at $ N yesterday a new offering seems unlikely company officials say <eos>
 business however continues to be robust and the stock market has n't affected the concern 's expansion plans says <unk> <unk> a senior executive <eos>
 other companies figure they ca n't avoid the market <eos>
 we have capital requirements says mr. <unk> so we have to go ahead with a planned $ N billion private placement <eos>
 unless the market goes right back up he says it may take us six to nine months to find the money instead of three <eos>

 as the market dropped friday robertson <unk> slashed the value of the offering by N N <eos>
 yesterday when similar securities rebounded it <unk> the valuation up again <eos>
 as of late yesterday the ipo was still on <eos>
 for many the situation is especially discouraging because the market for <unk> was showing signs of strengthening after several years of weakness <eos>

 many companies are <unk> <eos>

 for small companies he says interest rates are far more important than what happens on stock exchanges <eos>
 mr. <unk> thinks rates are heading down helping small companies <eos>
 peter <unk> biotechnology analyst for <unk> securities international chicago thinks market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations <eos>
 partly because the N market crash made it harder for them to find financing many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently <eos>

 alan wells president of <unk> wells <unk> & co. a new york merger specialist thinks <unk> investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy-out and giant takeover deals <eos>

 bay financial corp. hurt by high debts and deteriorating real estate investments reported a wider loss for the fourth quarter and said it might be forced to seek a bankruptcy-court reorganization if it ca n't <unk> its borrowings <eos>
 bay said a substantial part of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of inability to sell certain properties quickly and lower-than-expected prices for sales made <eos>
 the company said its real estate portfolio is highly leveraged while about two-thirds of its investments are n't <unk> <eos>
 thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments <eos>
 according to its latest annual report about a quarter of the company 's holdings are in massachusetts in the midst of a real-estate slump <eos>
 the company said it had a net loss in its fourth quarter ended june N of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million <eos>
 a year earlier the company had a loss of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million <eos>
 for the year it had a net loss of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million <eos>
 in the previous year it had a loss of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million <eos>
 although it is having serious <unk> problems bay said the <unk> value of its holdings minus debt was equal to $ N a share at june N based on a recent <unk> <eos>
 book value per share which is based on investments at cost was a negative $ N a share <eos>
 a year earlier <unk> value per share was $ N and book value was $ N a share <eos>

 <unk> inc. reported a N N decline in third-quarter net income but the company said that excluding unusual gains in both quarters operating profit rose N N <eos>
 the electronics automotive and aerospace concern said third-quarter net was $ N million or N cents a share down from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier <eos>
 share earnings are reported on a fully diluted basis by company tradition <eos>
 results for the N quarter included a gain of $ N a share from sale of the <unk> pump and <unk> cable units partly offset by a charge of N cents a share for recall of <unk> truck steering systems <eos>
 the latest quarter included a gain of N cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual recall costs <eos>
 sales for the quarter rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion with all three major product groups reporting gains <eos>
 the company said aerospace and defense sales were up N N for the quarter to $ N million and operating profit climbed N N to $ N million mainly because of improved program performance in spacecraft and <unk> contracts <eos>
 automotive sales jumped N N to $ N million mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems <unk> said <eos>
 the group had an operating profit of $ N million against a loss of $ N million a year earlier <eos>
 however excluding the year-earlier charge for recall of steering gear operating profit in the latest quarter declined N N reflecting higher start-up and product development expenses in <unk> systems <eos>
 materials and production costs also rose <unk> said <eos>
 the information systems segment had a N N jump sales to $ N million <eos>
 an acquisition accounted for half the sales rise <unk> said <eos>
 operating profit rose <unk> to $ N million from $ N million <eos>
 for the nine months <unk> 's net was $ N million or $ N a share down N N from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier <eos>
 sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion <eos>
 a <unk> <unk> by an <unk> not <unk> though <unk> <unk> english butler in his <unk> proceeds as if the realistic english novel of <unk> like <unk> herself still ruled the waves <eos>
 in fact <unk> <unk> 's the remains of the day <unk> N pages $ N is both an <unk> to traditional english forms and a dramatic <unk> of them <eos>
 it implies that the british empire was rooted in its subjects ' minds <unk> and <unk> and argues <unk> that its <unk> flaws were <unk> in the defensive <unk> willful <unk> <unk> and especially the <unk> of its domestic <unk> <eos>
 as the <unk> stevens the <unk> butler of <unk> hall <unk> over such <unk> terms as <unk> dignity service and loyalty we see how <unk> <unk> <unk> the soul <eos>
 stevens 's <unk> <unk> of the public and private <unk> like his <unk> master 's <unk> all it was designed to preserve <eos>
 such <unk> <unk> the <unk> <eos>
 the <unk> cuts to the quick <eos>
 it 's N the year the suez crisis marked the final end of empire <eos>
 as he stands on a hill at the beginning of a <unk> motor <unk> from <unk> to <unk> where a former <unk> <unk> perhaps the victim of an unhappy 20-year marriage perhaps he hopes with more <unk> than he will ever acknowledge not <unk> to return to domestic service stevens surveys the view and thereby provides a <unk> a <unk> and the author 's <unk> for the <unk> of the novel we 're reading <eos>
 we call this land of <unk> great britain and there may be those who believe this a somewhat <unk> practice <eos>
 yet i would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this <unk> <unk> <eos>
 it is the very lack of obvious drama or <unk> that sets the beauty of our land apart <eos>
 what is <unk> is the <unk> of that beauty its sense of restraint <eos>
 it is as though the land knows of its own beauty of its own <unk> and feels no need to <unk> it <eos>
 in comparison the sorts of sights offered in such places as africa and america though undoubtedly very exciting would i am sure strike the objective <unk> as <unk> on account of their <unk> <unk> <eos>
 an <unk> landscape <eos>
 an <unk> mountain <eos>
 but let stevens continue in his <unk> comic manner his <unk> efforts at <unk> always fail most <unk> this whole question is very <unk> to the question that has caused much debate in our profession over the years what is a great butler <eos>
 his answer is one <unk> of a dignity in keeping with his position <eos>
 such dignity has to do <unk> with a butler 's ability not to abandon the professional being he <unk> <eos>
 he will not be shaken out by external events however surprising <unk> or <unk> <eos>
 <unk> are unable to be <unk> because they are as a breed <unk> of the emotional restraint which only the english race are capable of <eos>
 despite his racial advantage to be a great butler is a <unk> calling one 's <unk> is not unlike general 's headquarters during a battle <eos>
 if for example in the midst of a great social occasion such as an international conference on <unk> the <unk> treaty in N one 's <unk> father himself a great butler once should happen to die of a <unk> one must continue to serve the port please do n't think me <unk> improper in not <unk> to see my father in his <unk> condition just at this moment <eos>
 you see i know my father would have <unk> me to carry on just now <eos>
 it is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows stevens to declare for all its sad associations whenever i recall that evening today i find i do so with a large sense of <unk> <eos>
 we note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and <unk> <eos>
 that stevens himself is not <unk> or <unk> but funny and sad and <unk> is entirely the author 's <unk> <eos>
 mr. <unk> 's ability to create a <unk> <unk> voice that permits him to explore such <unk> domestic cultural and political themes was <unk> clear in his previous novel an artist of the floating world set in japan after the war <eos>
 now shifting his scene from the country he left at five to the england he has lived in for nearly N years he has <unk> a novel in the mode of henry james and <unk> <unk> <eos>
 with great <unk> he considers not only <unk> <unk> and utterly <unk> sexual love but british <unk> the <unk> 's <unk> with democracy and support of <unk> and the moral <unk> of loyalty it is in practice simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude <unk> an employer and at the same time provide good service <eos>
 this employer <unk> all that i find noble and <unk> <eos>
 i will <unk> devote myself to serving him <eos>
 this is loyalty <unk> <unk> <eos>
 in the end after meeting with the former <unk> stevens sits by the <unk> at <unk> thinking of her and of his employer and declares i trusted <eos>
 i trusted in his <unk> 's wisdom <eos>
 i ca n't even say i made my own mistakes <eos>
 really one has to ask <unk> what dignity is there in that <eos>
 the loyal <unk> has come full circle <eos>
 what is <unk> <eos>
 what is dignity <eos>
 we understand such <unk> wisdom must be <unk> the <unk> of <unk> only spreads her wings at <unk> <eos>
 but as the remains of the day so <unk> demonstrates with quiet <unk> such wisdom can be <unk> <unk> in art <eos>

 <unk> <unk> who represents the soviet airline aeroflot here has some <unk> that are wild even by the current standards of perestroika <eos>
 in his office <unk> the runway of shannon airport mr. <unk> <unk> throws out what he calls just ideas <eos>
 first he suggests <unk> group ltd. the international aircraft leasing company based in ireland could lease some of its boeing <unk> to the soviet airline <eos>
 then aer <unk> the irish flag carrier could teach aeroflot pilots to fly the <unk> and the fleet could be based here at shannon airport <eos>
 that 's not all he says <eos>
 aer <unk> the irish airport authority could build a cargo terminal in the soviet union <eos>
 aeroflot could lease some of its cargo planes to aer <unk> through <unk> for a joint-venture cargo airline <eos>
 and then there is his notion of an <unk> charter airline to ferry <unk> to los angeles via shannon <eos>
 have the freedoms of glasnost gone to mr. <unk> 's head <eos>
 hardly <eos>
 the <unk> aviation connection is alive and well here at shannon airport <eos>
 <unk> is indeed talking about leasing western planes to aeroflot and even about buying <unk> <unk> <unk> <eos>
 aer <unk> is in discussions with the soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities <eos>
 aer <unk> already has so many ventures with aeroflot that its chief executive is studying russian <eos>
 unlikely as it may seem tiny politically neutral ireland has <unk> the mighty soviet airline bureaucracy <eos>
 and as aeroflot struggles to boost its service standards upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities the irish aviation industry seems poised to benefit <eos>
 irish and soviet people are similar says mr. <unk> <eos>
 they look the same <eos>
 they 're very friendly <eos>
 moreover he says irish companies are small but <unk> <eos>
 we have to study their experience very well he says <eos>
 we must find any way to get business <eos>
 the two groups have been working together since the late 1970s long before soviet joint ventures were the rage in the west <eos>
 aeroflot carried about N million passengers last year and shannon airport the airline 's largest transit airport outside the soviet union saw N aeroflot flights and N passengers pass through <eos>
 an apartment complex down the road is the <unk> and staging area for more than N aeroflot pilots and flight attendants <eos>
 the airport 's biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the soviet union <eos>
 <unk> from the <unk> port of <unk> each year unload N million gallons of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport <eos>
 what aeroflot does n't pour into its own <unk> <unk> is <unk> to the airport authority which <unk> it to N western carriers including air france trans world airlines and pakistan international airlines <eos>
 aeroflot thus pays its landing fees <unk> and <unk> bills with fuel preserving its hard currency <eos>
 that is n't all <eos>
 last year the irish airport authority in a joint venture with aeroflot opened four <unk> duty-free shops at moscow 's <unk> airport <eos>
 aer <unk> now manages duty-free sales on all aeroflot international flights out of moscow <eos>
 duty-free shops in <unk> 's <unk> airport opened in july and <unk> shops in <unk> hotels and on the <unk> <unk> are coming soon <eos>
 aer <unk> is talking about similar joint ventures in <unk> and in <unk> a black sea resort and even has a <unk> project cooking with the <unk> city of <unk> <eos>
 aeroflot 's international fleet of N planes is being <unk> and <unk> at shannon airport <eos>
 thanks to a new <unk> agreement and the ability of irish travel agents to issue aeroflot tickets tourists here are taking advantage of aeroflot 's reasonable prices to board flights in shannon for holidays in <unk> <unk> and mexico city <eos>
 the <unk> fare to <unk> is N irish punts $ N <eos>
 jamaica costs N punts <eos>
 a formal blessing of sorts was <unk> on this friendship in april when mikhail and <unk> gorbachev stopped here for talks with irish prime minister charles <unk> <eos>
 new trade accords were signed <eos>
 it all started with geography <eos>
 when it opened in N shannon was the first <unk> in europe for <unk> airplanes flying from north america <eos>
 advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a shannon stop unnecessary for most western air fleets but aeroflot still flies inefficient <unk> that ca n't make it from moscow to managua on one <unk> <eos>
 as a result ireland did n't <unk> the soviets after they shot down a korean air lines jetliner over the sea of japan in N though it suspended direct <unk> flights for two months <eos>
 in fact aer <unk> started <unk> russians from shannon to new york when washington stripped aeroflot of its u.s. landing rights <eos>
 today aer <unk> is making a <unk> of money from its soviet friendship <eos>
 and with those contacts in place it could be relatively simple to add aer <unk> and <unk> to the team <eos>
 then perhaps mr. <unk> 's ideas would n't sound like so much <unk> <eos>

 when <unk> corp. begins shipping steel from the world 's first <unk> plant this month it will begin testing the competitive <unk> of its giant competitors <eos>
 the new technology which creates a very thin piece of steel <unk> reduces the costs of making flat-rolled sheets <eos>
 an <unk> kenneth iverson <unk> 's chairman says the company 's plant eventually will make a ton of steel in N man hours compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill <eos>
 we 've had the russians and chinese and people from india visiting us mr. iverson <unk> <eos>
 everyone in the world is watching us very closely <eos>
 especially his neighbors the major u.s. steelmakers <eos>
 already usx corp. and armco inc. are studying <unk> 's technology to see if they can adopt it <eos>
 says the chief executive officer of a major midwest steel company it 's damn worrisome <eos>
 the <unk> steel industry is about to be turned <unk> by a 1990s technology revolution <eos>
 new efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller less <unk> companies to make steel at a fraction of what big steel paid decades ago <eos>
 it also enables minimills finally to get a <unk> in the flat-rolled steel market the major steelmakers ' largest most <unk> and until now <unk> market <eos>
 but such <unk> technology is only the beginning <eos>
 eager engineers <unk> <unk> and direct casting which by the end of the 1990s will enable production without coke <unk> and blast <unk> <eos>
 those massive structures while <unk> cost and environmental headaches effectively locked out all but <unk> giants from <unk> <eos>
 there 's a revolution ahead of us that will ultimately change the way we market and distribute steel says william dennis vice president manufacturing and technology for the american iron <unk> and steel institute <eos>
 it is n't that major steelmakers have <unk> ignored high technology <eos>
 in fact they 've spent billions of dollars to boost the percentage of <unk> cast steel to N N in N from N N five years before <eos>
 moreover their balance sheets are rich with diversity their old plants <unk> and work forces lean <eos>
 but that wo n't <unk> <eos>
 it 's no longer enough to beat the guy down the street <eos>
 you have to beat everyone around the world says mr. dennis <eos>
 he wants to see steelmakers more involved in computers and <unk> intelligence <eos>
 the problem they 're <unk> with huge plants that require costly maintenance <eos>
 and try <unk> new dollars free in a market that is softening hurt by a strong dollar and concerned about overcapacity the industry 's <unk> <unk> <eos>
 the technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established producers says peter marcus an analyst with painewebber inc <eos>
 they 've got too much invested in the old stuff and they ca n't get their workers to be flexible <eos>
 no one expects minimills to <unk> major integrated steelmakers who remain the <unk> <unk> of <unk> steel used for autos and refrigerators <eos>
 <unk> 's plant in <unk> ind. ultimately will produce only one million tons annually a drop in the <unk> flat-rolled steel <unk> and it will be years before such plants can compete in the <unk> market <eos>
 still flat-rolled is the steel industry 's bread and butter representing about half of the N million tons of steel expected to be shipped this year <eos>
 moreover the process is n't without its headaches <eos>
 because all operations are connected one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown <eos>
 on some days the <unk> plant does n't produce anything <eos>
 at this point the <unk> capacity wo n't make a great <unk> in the integrated market but it does challenge them to develop new markets says james mccall vice president materials at <unk> a technology and <unk> giant based in columbus ohio <eos>
 indeed with demand for steel not growing fast enough to absorb capacity steelmakers will have to change the way they do business <eos>
 in the past says armco 's chief economist john <unk> steelmakers made a product and set it out on the <unk> <unk> <eos>
 we said we 've got a product if you want it you can buy it he says adding now we 're figuring out what people need and are going back to make it <eos>
 armco 's sales representatives visit the general motors corp. 's <unk> assembly plant in kansas city mo. two or three days a week <eos>
 when they determined that gm needed parts more quickly armco convinced a steel service center to build a processing plant nearby so shipments could be delivered within N minutes <eos>
 <unk> such relationships with major clients car and <unk> makers is a means of survival especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and <unk> with plastic and aluminum makers <eos>
 for example when detroit began talking about <unk> cars the american iron and steel institute began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply <unk> how a car door is assembled <eos>
 but steelmakers must also find new markets <eos>
 after letting <unk> take the recycling lead a group of the nation 's largest steelmakers started a recycling institute to promote steel cans to an environmentally <unk> nation <eos>
 <unk> 's mr. mccall thinks steelmakers should concentrate more on construction <eos>
 weirton steel corp. weirton w. va. for example is touting to homeowners fashionable steel doors with <unk> glass <unk> as a secure and <unk> alternative to wooden or aluminum ones <eos>
 other steelmakers <unk> steel <unk> covering <unk> <eos>
 still others are looking at overseas markets <eos>
 usx is <unk> drilling pipe to <unk> soviet union <eos>
 this year the nation 's largest steelmaker <unk> its overseas sales operation <eos>
 producers also are trying to <unk> by concentrating on <unk> output such as coated and <unk> products which remain beyond the reach of minimills <eos>
 almost all <unk> programs announced by major steelmakers within the past year involve building <unk> lines used to produce steel for such products as household appliances and car doors <eos>
 but unfortunately that segment is much smaller than the bread-and-butter flat-rolled steel <eos>
 it 's like everyone climbing out of the <unk> ii and getting into a <unk> says john jacobson an analyst with <unk> consultants <eos>
 after a while someone has to go over the side <eos>
 although he does n't expect any <unk> he does see more plants being sold or closed <eos>
 robert crandall with the <unk> institute agrees <eos>
 unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar it 's unlikely that consumption of u.s. produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills <eos>
 not to mention the <unk> of imports <eos>
 japanese and european steelmakers which have led the recent technology developments are <unk> awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in N <eos>
 moreover the u.s. can expect more competition from low-cost producing pacific <unk> and latin american countries <eos>
 a taiwanese steelmaker recently announced plans to build a <unk> plant <eos>
 people think of the steel business as an old and mundane <unk> business says mr. iverson <eos>
 they 're dead wrong <eos>

 polaroid corp. 's <unk> damages case against eastman kodak co. one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever is getting <unk> attention on wall street <eos>
 after N days of <unk> testimony in federal court in boston the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys <eos>
 most have read the pre-trial documents however and estimate kodak will be ordered to pay $ N billion to $ N billion for <unk> on seven polaroid patents <eos>
 that may be the largest patent award ever but it is well below the $ N billion polaroid seeks <eos>
 the highest patent damage award to date was in N when smith international inc. was ordered to pay $ N million to baker hughes inc. for <unk> on a patent on an oil drilling bit seal <eos>
 the two companies later agreed to settle for $ N million <eos>
 few analysts think it is worth their time to <unk> through the polaroid trial testimony <eos>
 it 's like <unk> for gold outside of grand central station <eos>
 you might find something but the chances are low said michael <unk> an analyst at wertheim schroder & co <eos>
 and eugene glazer an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc. said if you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a prediction of the eventual award i would be willing to bet that he would be off by a lot <eos>
 a <unk> trial in the early 1980s determined that kodak based in rochester n.y. infringed on patents of polaroid of cambridge mass <eos>
 the main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was willful and <unk> <eos>
 if so the damages could be tripled <eos>
 two analysts who have read the <unk> david nelson of shearson lehman hutton inc. and <unk> d. <unk> a litigation analyst at <unk> simpson & co. think judge a. david <unk> will decide in kodak 's favor on the willful and <unk> issue <eos>
 mr. <unk> said testimony by kodak 's patent counsel francis t. carr of <unk> & <unk> showed that he worked with kodak <unk> from the outset of the project in an effort to avoid infringement <eos>
 carr told kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of polaroid 's patent positions and kodak followed his advice in every instance mr. <unk> said <eos>
 but irving <unk> a patent expert at george mason university school of law who is familiar with the case said the fact that seven patents were infringed suggests that infringement was willful <eos>
 it 's difficult to be that consistently wrong <eos>
 observers also wonder whether judge <unk> will use the <unk> method of determining damages which polaroid favors because it would result in a larger award or the reasonable royalty method <eos>
 polaroid claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by kodak if kodak had n't entered the market <eos>
 moreover polaroid contends it could have sold them at a higher price and thus made higher profits because it would n't have been forced to match kodak 's lower prices <eos>
 each side has called a harvard business school professor to testify on that issue <eos>
 kodak hired robert <unk> and polaroid brought in robert j. <unk> <eos>
 there 's nothing that says that people at harvard business school have to agree with each other said mr. <unk> <eos>
 testimony is expected to continue until early december <eos>
 a decision is n't expected until some time next year <eos>
 international business machines corp. said earnings tumbled N N in the third quarter even a bit further than expected <unk> the outlook doubtful for the next few quarters <eos>
 the main reason was a delay in shipment of new high-end disk drives a business that accounts for some N N of ibm 's $ N billion of annual revenue <eos>
 ibm which <unk> the poor results three weeks ago also cited an increase in its leasing business which tends to lock in business long-term but cut revenue in the near term <eos>
 in addition ibm noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into dollars <eos>
 earnings fell to $ N million or $ N a share somewhat below securities analysts ' revised expectations of around $ N a share <eos>
 that compared with the year-earlier $ N billion or $ N a share which was inflated by a <unk> gain from the sale of some mci communications corp. stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by fujitsu ltd. relating to a software dispute <eos>
 revenue climbed N N to $ N billion from $ N billion <eos>
 ibm armonk n.y. remained upbeat <eos>
 the computer giant whose u.s. results have been dismal for years noted that revenue rose again in the u.s. in the third quarter following an increase in the second period <eos>
 the company said in a statement that demand for ibm products and services continues to be good world-wide <eos>
 we do not see anything in the fundamentals of our business that would cause us to change our strategy of investing for profitable growth <eos>
 securities analysts however remained <unk> <eos>
 i think N will be another <unk> year said steve <unk> of first boston <eos>
 jay stevens of dean witter actually cut his per-share earnings estimate to $ N from $ N for N and to $ N from $ N in N because he decided sales would be even weaker than he had expected <eos>
 both estimates would mark declines from the N net of $ N billion or $ N a share which itself was well below the record ibm set in N <eos>
 mr. stevens said he kept a <unk> recommendation on the stock only because all the damage has been done <eos>
 he said the stock has n't traded below N N times book value over the past N years which at the moment <unk> to a stock price of $ N <eos>
 the stock closed yesterday at $ N a share up just $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange as the market surged <eos>
 analysts worry that the disk-drive and leasing problems will last at least through the first quarter <eos>
 a key part of the question is how soon does this disk-drive come and how soon does production <unk> up said steve cohen at <unk> financial group <eos>
 and the input i 've had from customers is that it still could be a while <eos>
 on leasing bob <unk> at <unk> research said he thinks ibm has hurt itself <unk> <eos>
 he said ibm has priced its leases aggressively thinking that would help win business <eos>
 but he said ibm would have won the business anyway as a sale to a third party that would have then leased the equipment to the customer <eos>
 he said ibm has not only hurt its short-term revenue outlook but has also been losing money on its leases <eos>
 bob <unk> executive vice president of marketing at <unk> inc. a huge leasing firm said to put it mildly ibm credit has been doing some of the worst economic deals of any leasing company we have ever seen <eos>
 ibm is expected to get a boost soon when it <unk> some new versions of its mainframes <eos>
 but the basic technology in the line is almost five years old which means it is long in the <unk> and competitors are rolling out strong products of their own <eos>
 ibm is gaining momentum in the personal-computer market and is expected to introduce some impressive workstations early next year <eos>
 but it 's hard to squeeze much profit out of the personal-computer business these days and the workstation market while important is too small to rely on for much growth <eos>
 the disk drives will <unk> sell well when they finally become available <eos>
 but the <unk> ibm 's highly successful <unk> line is losing its momentum and some analysts said sales could even decline in the fourth quarter <eos>
 in addition ibm 's growth in software in the third quarter was just N N well below historical levels even when adjusted to reflect last year 's payment from fujitsu and the stronger dollar <eos>
 and expenses up N N in the quarter have stayed <unk> high <eos>
 in the nine months ibm earned $ N billion or $ N a share down N N from the year-earlier $ N billion or $ N a share <eos>
 revenue increased N N to $ N billion from $ N billion <eos>
 pepsico inc. 's chairman said he is more than comfortable with analysts ' estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to at least N cents to $ N a share from N cents the year earlier <eos>
 d. wayne calloway also chief executive officer of the company indicated that he expects analysts to raise their forecasts for N after the company releases its earnings today <eos>
 so far analysts have said they are looking for $ N to $ N a share <eos>

 the official said he also would be comfortable with that new range <eos>

 results for N will include about N cents a share from the <unk> effects of snack-food and bottling company acquisitions <eos>
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange the company closed yesterday at $ N a share up $ N <eos>
 the company said third-quarter sales are expected to increase N N from $ N billion of last year 's third quarter <eos>
 domestic soft-drink <unk> case sales are estimated to have risen only N N in the third quarter well below the N N to N N growth of recent years but about in line with the rest of the soft-drink industry <eos>
 mr. calloway blamed the slower volume on <unk> weather a <unk> of new products in the industry and to a much lesser extent pricing <eos>
 pepsico said its soft-drink prices were about N N higher in the quarter <eos>
 mr. calloway also noted that soft-drink volume rose a hefty N N in last year 's third quarter making the comparison more difficult <eos>
 international soft-drink volume was up about N N <eos>
 snack-food <unk> increased a strong N N in the third quarter while domestic profit increased in double <unk> mr. calloway said <eos>
 excluding the british snack-food business acquired in july snack-food international <unk> jumped N N with sales strong in spain mexico and brazil <eos>
 total snack-food profit rose N N <eos>
 led by pizza hut and <unk> bell restaurant earnings increased about N N in the third quarter on a N N sales increase <eos>
 <unk> sales for pizza hut rose about N N while <unk> bell 's increased N N as the chain continues to benefit from its <unk> strategy <eos>
 <unk> bell has turned around declining customer counts by permanently lowering the price of its <unk> <eos>
 same <unk> for kentucky fried chicken which has struggled with increased competition in the fast-food chicken market and a lack of new products rose only N N <eos>
 the operation which has been slow to respond to consumers ' shifting <unk> away from fried foods has been developing a <unk> product that may be introduced nationally at the end of next year <eos>
 the new product has performed well in a market test in las vegas nev. mr. calloway said <eos>
 after a four-year $ N billion acquisition binge that brought a major soft-drink company soda <unk> a fast-food chain and an overseas snack-food giant to pepsi mr. calloway said he does n't expect any major acquisition in the next year or so <eos>

 hydro-quebec said it notified central maine power co. it will cancel a $ N billion contract to supply electricity to the maine utility <eos>
 the <unk> owned utility said it is <unk> up the deal because the contract 's objectives ca n't be <unk> <eos>
 hydro-quebec said maine regulators ' refusal to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried through maine to other utilities <eos>
 it would now be <unk> impossible to begin deliveries in N a hydro-quebec official said <eos>
 the contract was to run from N to N <eos>
 under the contract hydro-quebec was to supply N <unk> of power to central maine power starting in N N <unk> starting in N and N <unk> starting in <eos>
 hydro-quebec said maine regulators ' refusal to approve the contract means central maine power has lost its place in line <eos>
 we wo n't sign any new contracts with deliveries beginning earlier than N the hydro-quebec official said <eos>
 he said hydro-quebec already has some customers in mind for the power that was to be delivered to maine <eos>
 nothing has happened since we signed the contract to undermine our conviction that hydro-quebec was the <unk> most environmentally acceptable choice for meeting a part of our customers ' energy needs through the year N said central maine senior vice president donald f. kelly <eos>
 central maine said it is evaluating many energy options to make up for the lost future power including new energy generation and management proposals from new england and possibly new canadian purchases <eos>
 chicago options traders were among the big victims of friday 's plunging stock market including one small firm that required an emergency $ N million bailout <eos>
 while monday 's rebounding markets helped other investors recoup losses many options customers and professional traders in stock-index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with multimillion-dollar losses traders here and in new york said <eos>
 options traders were hurt worse than others on friday because of the highly volatile nature of options which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based <eos>
 thus options traders friday were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock traders in new york <eos>
 jeffrey miller of miller <unk> <unk> & co. said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market it is very easy for these guys to get wiped out <eos>
 that may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little creatures <eos>
 an options contract gives the holder the right to buy call or sell put a specific amount of stock or in this case the value of a stock index based on a <unk> price within a given time period <eos>
 options traders who in return for a small fee or premium had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on friday to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling <eos>
 they then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices in most cases at a substantial loss <eos>
 the latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the chicago board options exchange which has never fully recovered from the <unk> of black monday when investors fled the market because of huge losses <eos>
 making matters worse was the fact that late friday afternoon the cboe halted stock-index options trading in step with the chicago mercantile exchange 's halt in stock-index futures <eos>
 but while the merc reopened a half hour later the cboe remained closed leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses <eos>
 cboe chairman <unk> duke <unk> said that unlike the futures market the options exchange has to open in a <unk> that allows each different options series to trade <eos>
 exchange officials <unk> that they would n't have been able to make such a <unk> with the time remaining friday afternoon and with the stock-index futures on the verge of closing for a second and final time the cboe <unk> that its best course was to remain closed <eos>
 the damage was so bad at fossett corp. an options trading firm here that it was forced to transfer its accounts to first options of chicago a unit of continental bank corp. as a result of options trading losses <eos>
 <unk> so far is the only member of a financial exchange to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of friday 's rout <eos>
 fossett still had several million dollars in capital left after friday 's close of trading but not enough that regulators worried about another potential market plunge yesterday would let it reopen for trading options exchange officials said <eos>
 thus in an unprecedented arrangement <unk> the <unk> of the transfer the cboe the american stock exchange and the options clearing corp. as well as the firm 's owner stephen fossett put up a total of $ N million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday <eos>

 the bailout was <unk> together over the weekend with officials from the federal reserve board securities and exchange commission comptroller of the currency and treasury as well as the options exchanges <eos>
 it was great to have the luxury of time mr. <unk> said <eos>
 at one point an options industry official had to talk the federal reserve bank of chicago 's night <unk> into giving him the home phone number of <unk> <unk> chicago fed president <eos>
 first options did n't have to put any money into the bailout <eos>
 yesterday 's rally in the stock futures and options markets led cboe and amex officials to conclude that the $ N million in guarantees almost certainly wo n't need to be tapped by first options <eos>
 the fossett firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the october N crash as well mr. <unk> said <eos>
 a federal official said that continental bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the fossett bailout but that conditions were n't <unk> by those agencies <eos>
 it was their business decision the official said <eos>
 officials at options clearing corp. which processes all options trades for u.s. exchanges said that the $ N million guarantee was unprecedented but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets <eos>
 it was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps said paul stevens <unk> president and chief operating officer <eos>
 mr. stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $ N million guarantee from each participant <eos>
 but cboe and amex officials said that options clearing corp. contributed $ N million to the guarantee the cboe put up $ N million the amex added $ N million and $ N million came from mr. fossett 's own assets <eos>

 in what is believed to be the first cancellation of a loan to china since the june N killings in beijing an international bank syndicate has terminated a $ N million credit for a shanghai property project <eos>
 the syndicate led by <unk> asia ltd. agreed last november to provide the loan to asia development corp. a u.s. property developer <eos>
 but several weeks ago in the wake of the beijing killings the loan was canceled according to bankers and executives close to the project <eos>
 asia development and <unk> declined to comment on the move <eos>
 lenders had doubts about the project even before june N but the harsh crackdown which caused many businesses to <unk> their china transactions gave the banks the out they wanted says an official close to the shanghai venture <eos>
 the decision to cancel the loan <unk> the tough attitude bankers have taken toward china since june N <eos>
 while some commercial lending has resumed international lenders remain nervous about china 's economic troubles and foreign debt $ N billion at the end of N <eos>
 many loans are being <unk> especially those tied to the hotel sector which has been hit hard by a <unk> N tourism slump <eos>
 many bankers view <unk> loans as particularly risky <eos>

 the company owes $ N million to the <unk> on group the project 's hong kong contractor and a significant though unspecified amount in legal fees to <unk> brothers a u.s. law firm the sources say <eos>
 the project known as lotus mansion has been mired in controversy <eos>
 when the loan agreement was announced it was hailed as one of the first western-style financing transactions ever used in china <eos>
 unlike most loans to china there was no chinese <unk> <eos>
 instead the banks secured a promise from state-owned bank of communications that it would lend asia development the entire $ N million at maturity to finance repayment of the original borrowing <eos>
 the loan was to have <unk> in just two to three years as soon as construction was completed <eos>
 but in a letter sent in august to asia development <unk> said the loan was terminated because the developer had failed to deliver adequate financial data and pay certain fees to the <unk> committee on time according to officials close to the project <eos>
 creditors involved in the project contend however that the termination actually had nothing to do with these technical violations <eos>
 instead the creditors say the loan fell victim to nervousness about china 's political turmoil as well as to concern about the loan 's security <eos>

 k mart corp. agreed to acquire pace membership warehouse inc. for $ N a share or $ N million in a move to expand its presence in the rapidly growing <unk> business <eos>
 the proposed merger comes as k mart 's profit is declining and sales at its core discount stores are rising more slowly than at such competitors as <unk> stores inc <eos>
 k mart based in <unk> mich. recently said net income would fall for the third consecutive quarter after a N N drop in the first half of its current fiscal year <eos>
 the membership <unk> concept has great potential the company 's chairman joseph e. <unk> said in a statement <eos>
 warehouse clubs typically carry general merchandise and food products which they sell for close to wholesale prices in <unk> stores <eos>
 shoppers many of whom operate small businesses pay annual membership fees which provide an income base for the stores <eos>
 k mart tested the <unk> sector last year with its acquisition of a N N interest in <unk> inc <eos>
 but the <unk> chain which operates as a joint venture between k mart and shv holdings n.v. of the netherlands has only six stores and annual sales that one analyst estimated at about $ N million <eos>
 <unk> pace based in <unk> colo. operates N <unk> stores <eos>
 the company had losses for several years before turning profitable in fiscal N <eos>
 in the year ended jan. N pace <unk> up profit of $ N million or N cents a share after a tax-loss carry-forward on sales of $ N billion and analysts expect its results to continue to improve <eos>
 the company turned the corner fairly recently in profitability said <unk> <unk> of painewebber inc. who had been forecasting a N N jump in pace 's net income from operations this year and another N N increase next year <eos>
 warehouse productivity is really beginning to take off <eos>
 but some analysts contend k mart has agreed to pay too much for pace <eos>
 even if you look at it as a turnaround situation it 's expensive said wayne <unk> of prudential-bache securities inc <eos>
 in my opinion you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier player in the industry <eos>
 ms. <unk> of painewebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal <eos>
 if k mart ca n't get its act together in discounting why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets <eos>
 she said i would say k mart 's number one job is to address its market-share loss in discount stores which longer-term will lead to improved profit margins <eos>
 at that point perhaps diversification would be appropriate <eos>
 but k mart 's mr. <unk> is intent on pushing the company into new retail businesses <eos>
 for instance k mart is opening big food and general merchandise stores called <unk> and <unk> stores specializing in office products and sporting goods <eos>
 it also operates <unk> pay less drug stores and builders square home improvement stores <eos>
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange k mart closed yesterday at $ N a share up N cents <eos>
 pace rose $ N to close at $ N a share in national over-the-counter trading <eos>
 a k mart spokesman said the acquisition would be financed with short-term borrowings <eos>
 under terms of the agreement a k mart subsidiary will soon make a tender offer for pace shares <eos>
 among the conditions of the offer is that pace shareholders tender a majority of the company 's shares outstanding <eos>
 the companies said pace would ill continue to operate under its present management <eos>

 traders nervously watching their quotron <unk> machines yesterday morning were stunned to see the dow jones industrial average plummet N points in seconds <eos>
 a minute later it soared N points then <unk> back down N points N below friday 's close <eos>
 it was crazy said neil <unk> general partner of <unk> capital corp <eos>
 it was like flying without a pilot in the front of the plane <eos>
 but those who said this ca n't be happening were right <eos>
 the <unk> were wrong <eos>
 quotron systems inc. a citicorp unit blamed the <unk> <unk> on a timing problem in our software caused by the enormous early volume about N million shares in the first hour of new york stock exchange trading <eos>
 the prices of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct quotron said but the average was wrong <eos>
 meanwhile there was an awful lot of confusion <eos>
 at about N a.m. on the over-the-counter trading desk at a major brokerage firm a veteran trader who buys and sells some of the most active stocks looked at a senior official and asked what 's going on <eos>
 is the market up or down <eos>
 at the time quotron was reporting that the industrial average was down N points <eos>
 in fact it was up N <eos>
 <unk> stark a vice president who heads the trading desk at dillon read capital corp. said that once she figured out the quotron numbers were wrong she called brokers to tell them <eos>
 it 's been kind of <unk> to say the least she said <eos>
 to <unk> matters further when ual corp. stock finally opened on the new york stock exchange at N a.m. the price was listed at $ N a share up about $ N from friday in fact its true price was $ N down $ N <eos>
 that was the new york stock exchange 's <unk> <eos>
 a spokesman cited a technical error and declined to elaborate <eos>
 and there were other <unk> <eos>
 when the market opened at N a.m. est a reporter for the reuters <unk> <unk> the industrial average 's drop as a N N decline when it really was down N N <eos>
 it was a case of human error which we found almost immediately and corrected a spokesman for reuter in new york said <eos>
 meanwhile some currency traders at west german banks in frankfurt said they sold dollars on the news and had to buy them back later at higher prices <eos>
 but it was the quotron problems that had <unk> effects <eos>
 dillon read 's ms. stark said in early afternoon that she was still <unk> prices and other data as subject to <unk> and she said portfolio managers continued to question the numbers they saw on the screen <eos>
 it was the second time in less than a week that quotron has had problems <unk> the industrial average <eos>

 actually it was down only a few points at the time <eos>
 quotron said that <unk> which lasted nine minutes resulted from a failure to adjust for a <unk> stock split at philip morris <unk> <eos>

 houston attorney dale friend representing a plaintiff in a damage suit says he has negotiated a settlement that will strike a blow for his client <eos>
 literally <eos>
 it turns out mr. friend 's client <unk> parks of cincinnati did n't like the way defense attorney tom alexander acted during the legal proceedings <eos>
 so she has agreed to <unk> monetary damages against mr. alexander 's client in return for the right to <unk> the attorney <eos>
 ms. parks 's mother also gets to <unk> mr. alexander <eos>
 so does mr. friend and his law partner <unk> <unk> <eos>
 the bizarre arrangement grows out of mr. alexander 's representation of <unk> construction co. one of several defendants in a <unk> death lawsuit brought by ms. parks the widow of a construction worker killed in january N while working on a new houston convention center <eos>
 last month mr. friend says mr. alexander 's associate agreed that <unk> would pay $ N as part of an overall settlement <eos>
 but mr. alexander <unk> the deal at the last minute <unk> the plaintiff 's side <eos>
 i never agreed to it mr. alexander says adding that it 's not necessary to pay these <unk> settlements <eos>
 when ms. parks and her mother heard about what had happened mr. friend says they <unk> that they would like to give mr. alexander a good <unk> <eos>
 mr. friend says he passed that along to his adversary and soon they were talking about the ground rules under which <unk> could keep its money and the plaintiffs could take a shot at mr. alexander <eos>
 although time and place have yet to be determined some details are in place <eos>
 mr. friend says he agreed to strike mr. alexander above the belt <eos>
 ms. parks and her mother indicated they want to catch him <unk> from behind he says <eos>
 mr. alexander for his part insisted that the <unk> ca n't <unk> their <unk> rights to anyone else ca n't use a blunt instrument and ca n't take a running start <eos>
 mr. alexander says he <unk> the agreement which has n't been submitted to a judge as something of a joke <eos>
 however he acknowledges they have the option of taking a <unk> at me if they really want to <eos>
 mr. friend says his side is dead serious <eos>
 although they do n't <unk> delivering any <unk> <unk> he says that mr. alexander will be asked to sign a release from liability just in case <eos>
 after two years of drought it <unk> money in the stock-index futures markets yesterday <eos>
 as financial markets rebounded trading volume in the chicago mercantile exchange 's huge standard & poor 's N stock-index futures pit soared reaching <unk> levels for the first time since october N <eos>
 the sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap <unk> <unk> in a matter of minutes as prices soared traders said <eos>
 guys were <unk> money in there today said john <unk> a futures broker for elders futures inc. in chicago <eos>
 the s&p N futures contract which moves in <unk> of an index point under normal conditions jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an initial downturn then moved strongly higher the rest of the day <eos>
 each index point represents a $ N profit for each s&p N contract held <eos>
 for the first time since the N crash traders said that they were able to trade several hundred s&p N contracts at a time in a highly liquid market <eos>
 many institutions and individual investors have <unk> away from stock-index futures blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on black monday two years ago <eos>
 since the crash many futures traders have n't assumed large positions for fear that the s&p N market with much of its customer order flow missing would dry up if prices turned against them <eos>
 more than N traders <unk> the s&p N futures pit to await the opening bell <eos>
 traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at N am <eos>
 the contract fell five points at the open to N the maximum opening move allowed under <unk> adopted by the merc to stem a market slide <eos>
 but several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts driving prices sharply higher <eos>
 the market <unk> near friday 's closing price of N for about a half hour moving several index points higher or lower in seconds then broke higher and did n't look back <eos>
 the s&p N contract that expires in december closed up a record N points on volume of nearly N contracts <eos>
 traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart said one s&p N broker <eos>
 you could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune he <unk> <eos>
 several of wall street 's largest securities firms including salomon brothers inc. and painewebber inc. were also large buyers traders said <eos>
 salomon brothers was among the largest sellers of stock-index futures last week traders said <eos>
 brokerage firms as a rule do n't comment on their market activity <eos>
 unlike the week following black monday two years ago individual traders in the s&p N pit were also being <unk> <unk> about their one-day profits <eos>
 with the fbi around here <unk> rights are a thing of the past said one trader referring to the federal investigation of futures trading that so far has resulted in N <unk> <unk> against individuals on the merc and the chicago board of trade <eos>
 the market for $ N billion of high-yield junk bonds regained some of its footing as the dow jones industrial average rebounded from friday 's plunge <eos>
 but the junk recovery led by the bellwether rjr holdings bonds was <unk> <eos>
 no trading existed for the vast majority of junk bonds securities industry officials said <eos>
 on friday trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential buyers fled and brokerage firms were unwilling to provide bid and offer prices for most issues <eos>
 nothing traded on friday and people were n't really sure where the market should have opened yesterday said raymond <unk> <unk> of merchant banking at merrill lynch & co <eos>
 but we had a fairly active day yesterday <eos>
 at drexel burnham lambert inc. the leading underwriter of junk bonds i was prepared to be in a very bad mood tonight said david <unk> a junk bond trader <eos>
 now i feel maybe there 's a little bit of euphoria <eos>
 but before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell-off yesterday he said you could n't buy junk bonds and you could n't give them away <eos>
 yesterday 's rally was led by rjr holdings N N N bonds which initially tumbled three points or $ N for each $ N face amount to N N before rebounding to N N <eos>
 bonds issued by <unk> <unk> <unk> and american standard also showed big gains recovering almost all their losses from friday and early yesterday <eos>
 but traders said the junk bond market increasingly is <unk> into a <unk> group in which trades can be executed easily and a larger group of <unk> bonds in which liquidity or the ability to trade without too much difficulty has steadily deteriorated this year <eos>
 liquidity has n't returned to the vast middle ground of the market said mr. <unk> of merrill <eos>
 the <unk> are still <unk> said mr. <unk> of drexel <eos>
 analysts are concerned that much of the high-yield market will remain <unk> for investors <eos>
 paul <unk> associate professor at the massachusetts institute of technology 's sloan school of management citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later says we 're now in a period where we 're starting to see defaults from the big issue years of N to N <eos>
 mark <unk> a senior vice president at standard & poor 's corp. confirms that there is increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market <eos>
 junk bonds are a highly <unk> market said lewis <unk> vice chairman of smith barney harris upham & co <eos>
 there 's a whole bunch of stuff that 's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that 's not so good <eos>
 analysts at standard & poor 's say junk bond offerings by tightly stretched issuers seem to be growing <eos>
 almost $ N billion of junk bonds that are considered <unk> include issues from sci tv gillette holdings not related to gillette co. <unk> <unk> furniture allied stores federated department stores national <unk> <unk> holdings <unk> leaseway transportation and price communications <eos>
 you could still have some very bad times ahead said mr. <unk> <eos>
 it 's possible to have a N N default rate in one year because we 're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy <eos>
 i 'm certainly not comfortable saying we 've seen the bottom <eos>
 but yesterday 's rally among good junk was a badly needed <unk> for the market <eos>
 many issues bounced off the floor mr. <unk> said and benchmark junk issues recovered all of their losses from friday and early yesterday <eos>
 in contrast he says the stock market gained back only about half what it lost friday and the government bond market lost about half what it gained friday <eos>
 traders said yesterday 's rally was fueled by insurance companies looking for bargains after a drastic slide in prices the past month <eos>
 in addition mutual funds did n't appear to be major sellers of high-yield securities as was expected <eos>
 sometimes a <unk> is healthy said drexel 's mr. <unk> <eos>
 people will learn to be more <unk> <eos>
 if they do good credit analysis they will avoid the hand <unk> <eos>
 i think the market is in good shape <eos>
 should you really own stocks <eos>
 that 's a question a lot of people are asking following the stock market 's stunning display of volatility <eos>
 <unk> financially and <unk> by friday 's <unk> 190-point drop in the dow jones industrial average and yesterday 's <unk> rebound they 're wondering if an individual has any business being in the market <eos>
 the answer say academic researchers money managers and investment specialists is yes as long as you approach the stock market as an investor <eos>
 but they say people should n't try to be traders who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock <eos>
 the case for owning stocks over the long-term is compelling <eos>
 if you look at N years worth of investment history including the great depression and every bear market since stocks have outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot says barry berlin vice president at first wachovia capital management <eos>
 a dollar invested in the stock market in N would have grown to $ N by the end of last june according to laurence <unk> managing director at <unk> associates inc <eos>
 but a dollar invested in long-term bonds in N would have grown to only $ N and a dollar put in treasury bills would equal a <unk> $ N <eos>
 the longer the time period the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market <eos>
 over time the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio <eos>
 for instance ken gregory a san francisco money manager <unk> that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the standard & poor 's 500-stock index the chance of losing money is N N to N N over a 10-year period compared with N N over three years and N N over one year <eos>
 if you do n't need the money for N years there 's a <unk> case for sticking to a steady core of stocks mr. gregory says <eos>
 stock-market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns says john <unk> jr. president of the institute of certified financial planners <eos>
 stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate bonds international securities and cash he says <eos>
 there are some important <unk> before investing in stocks individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank most investment advisers say <eos>
 individuals also should focus on building equity in a home which provides some protection against inflation as well as a <unk> that can be <unk> in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living <eos>
 people also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future for example for college tuition payments or retirement expenses <eos>
 you may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge says mr. <unk> a del <unk> calif. financial planner <eos>
 but once the <unk> are covered then i would start to invest even if it 's as little as $ N says michael lipper president of lipper analytical services inc <eos>
 he says individuals should consider not just stocks but other long-term investments such as high-quality bonds <eos>
 despite the strong case for stocks however most pros warn that individuals should n't try to profit from short-term developments <eos>
 it 's very difficult to do says donald holt a market strategist for <unk> morgan securities a los angeles brokerage firm <eos>
 our markets move so fast and they are so volatile there 's no way the average investor can compete with the pros <eos>
 individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market <eos>
 the cost of executing stock orders <unk> from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order but N N of the order 's value is an average says stephen boesel manager of t. rowe price 's growth and income mutual fund <eos>
 and assuming their first investment is successful investors will have to pay taxes on their gains <eos>
 that can reduce returns by a third or more once local taxes are included mr. lipper says <eos>
 after that individual traders face the risk that the new investment they choose wo n't perform well so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing <eos>
 it 's very tough for most individuals to <unk> the mutual funds or the market says mr. lipper <eos>
 you should really think twice if you think you can <unk> the system <eos>
 then too many individual investors lack the <unk> emotional makeup professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market <eos>
 so what 's the best way to buy stocks <eos>
 unless an individual has a minimum of between $ N and $ N to invest in stocks he 's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker says mr. lipper <eos>
 still he adds i could see owning both given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in <unk> special situations based on their own <unk> he adds <eos>
 george douglas first vice president at drexel burnham lambert inc. says that individuals have a particular edge now in small to <unk> niche companies with exciting earnings prospects a traditional <unk> ground for small investors <eos>
 this growth sector which usually carries a <unk> multiple about twice that of the standard & poor 's N happens to include some of the market 's most attractive bargains right now <eos>
 it 's now selling at a multiple about even with the market says mr. douglas <eos>
 moreover mr. douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term <eos>
 many big wall street brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now <unk> coverage of this area he notes <eos>
 we 're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks he says <eos>
 the pros <unk> advise individuals to stay away from the latest investment fad <eos>
 they say that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle when there 's no robust bull market to bail investors out of their mistakes <eos>
 friday 's correction presents a pretty good buying opportunity but let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle says <unk> <unk> chief equity portfolio strategist at first boston corp <eos>
 buy stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals he says <eos>
 in the long run investment advisers say most investors will be better off using the <unk> averaging method of buying stocks <eos>
 in this method a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down <eos>
 that cuts the risk mr. gregory the san francisco money manager points out <eos>
 when the market is low you are buying more shares and when it 's high you 're buying fewer shares he says <eos>
 otherwise if you put all your money in at one time by sheer bad luck you might pick a terrible time and have to wait three years to get even mr. gregory says <eos>
 a disciplined program will work the best mr. boesel says <eos>
 one of the hardest things to do is to buy stocks when the market is down he says <eos>
 but that 's just the time when you should be buying them <eos>

 donald trump who faced rising doubt about his bid for american airlines parent amr corp. even before a united airlines buy-out came apart friday withdrew his $ N billion offer <eos>
 separately bankers representing the group trying to buy united 's parent ual corp. met with other banks about <unk> that purchase at a lower price possibly around $ N a share or $ N billion <eos>
 but a lower bid could face rejection by the ual board <eos>
 mr. trump who vowed wednesday to go forward with the bid said he was dropping it in light of the recent change in market conditions <eos>
 he said he might now sell his amr stake buy more shares or make another offer at a lower price <eos>
 the manhattan real-estate developer acted after the ual buyers failed to obtain financing for their earlier $ 300-a-share bid which sparked a selling panic among that <unk> into a 190-point drop friday in the dow jones industrial average <eos>
 news about ual and amr whose shares never reopened after trading was halted friday for the ual announcement sent both stocks <unk> in composite trading on the new york stock exchange <eos>
 ual tumbled $ N to $ N on volume of N million shares and amr declined by $ N to $ N as N million shares changed hands <eos>
 together the two stocks <unk> havoc among takeover stock traders and caused a N N drop in the dow jones transportation average second in size only to the stock-market crash of oct. N N <eos>
 some said friday 's market debacle had given mr. trump an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of <unk> even before problems emerged with the ual deal <eos>
 after reaching an intraday high of $ N the day mr. trump disclosed his bid oct. N amr 's stock had retreated as low as $ N last week <eos>
 some takeover stock traders had been betting against mr. trump because he has a record of disclosing stakes in companies that are potential takeover targets then selling at a profit without making a bid <eos>
 he still has n't proven his <unk> as a <unk> <unk> artist said airline analyst kevin murphy of morgan stanley & co <eos>
 he 's done this thing where he 'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it <eos>
 he 's written this book the art of the deal <eos>
 why does n't he just follow through on one of these things <eos>
 mr. trump withdrew his bid before the amr board which is due to meet tomorrow ever formally considered it <eos>
 amr had weighed a wide range of possible responses from flat rejection to <unk> and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees a <unk> buyer such as texas billionaire robert bass or both <eos>
 amr had also sought to <unk> mr. trump in congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the transportation department to reject airline buy-outs <eos>
 yesterday mr. trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the ual deal on congress saying it was rushing through a bill to protect amr executives <eos>
 i believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the ual transaction and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past friday mr. trump wrote members of congress <eos>
 amr declined to comment and mr. trump did n't respond to requests for interviews <eos>
 mr. trump never said how much amr stock he had bought only that his holdings were substantial <eos>
 however he only received federal clearance to buy more than $ N million of the stock on sept. N when the price rose $ N a share to $ N <eos>
 between then and his bid on oct. N the price <unk> between $ N and $ N <eos>
 in an attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just a stock play mr. trump promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares <eos>
 amr was trading at around $ N yesterday before his withdrawal announcement then immediately fell to about $ N <eos>
 assuming that he paid a rough average price of $ N a share and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market mr. trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ N <eos>
 some analysts said amr chairman robert crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation 's largest airline with a defensive transaction such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees <eos>
 however other knowledgeable observers said they believed mr. crandall and the amr board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps <eos>
 some analysts said they believed mr. trump whose <unk> <unk> had been viewed by some as a reason to believe he would n't back out might come back with a lower bid <eos>
 ray <unk> of dillon read & co. said mr. trump is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle <eos>
 i 'm sure he still wants amr <eos>
 but others remained skeptical <eos>
 i was never sure donald trump really wanted to take amr said john <unk> a bond analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc <eos>
 what happened with united was a <unk> way for him to <unk> out <eos>
 mr. trump never obtained financing for his bid <eos>
 that skepticism would leave him with an even greater credibility problem should he return that would <unk> him in any effort to oust the board in a proxy fight <eos>
 meanwhile citicorp and chase manhattan corp. the two lead lenders on the ual buy-out met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy-out at a lower price <eos>
 officials familiar with the talks said citicorp had discussed lowering the offer to $ N a share but said that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made <eos>
 at $ N a share the group would have to borrow about $ N billion from banks <eos>
 the first ual deal unraveled after citibank and chase could n't raise $ N billion <eos>
 citibank and chase had agreed to commit $ N billion and said they were highly confident of raising another $ N billion <eos>
 together citicorp and chase received $ N million in fees to raise the rest of the financing <eos>
 but other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the ual group was willing to pay them <eos>
 officials familiar with the bank talks said the ual buy-out group ual pilots management and british airways plc is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest but is n't likely to boost its $ N million equity contribution <eos>
 nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next N hours despite the hopes of many traders <eos>
 the group 's advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around <eos>
 even if the buy-out group is able to obtain financing the transaction still faces obstacles <eos>
 ual 's board could reject the new price as too low especially since there are n't any competing bids <eos>
 los angeles investor marvin davis whose $ <unk> offer was rejected by ual 's board has n't shown signs of pursuing a $ 300-a-share <unk> bid he made last month <eos>
 in addition the coalition of labor and management longtime enemies who joined forces only under the threat of mr. davis 's bid could break apart now <eos>
 the group 's resilience gets its first test today when N top pilot union leaders <unk> outside chicago in a previously scheduled meeting <eos>
 union chairman <unk> rick <unk> faces the tough task of explaining why banks refused to finance a buy-out the members approved <unk> last week <eos>
 the pilot union is <unk> to pursue an acquisition whatever the board decides <eos>
 but if the board <unk> a reduced bid and decides to explore other alternatives it could transform what has been a <unk> process into an <unk> one <eos>
 the pilots could play <unk> by noting they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes <eos>
 if they were to insist on a low bid of say $ N a share the board might n't be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction the pilots oppose <eos>
 also because ual chairman stephen wolf and other ual executives have joined the pilots ' bid the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders <eos>
 that could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder <eos>
 influential members of the house ways and means committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts <eos>
 the bill whose backers include chairman dan <unk> d. ill. would prevent the resolution trust corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an <unk> bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget <eos>
 the bill intends to restrict the rtc to treasury borrowings only unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization <eos>
 such agency <unk> borrowing is unauthorized and expensive far more expensive than direct treasury borrowing said rep. <unk> stark d. calif. the bill 's chief sponsor <eos>
 the complex financing plan in the s&l bailout law includes raising $ N billion from debt issued by the newly created rtc <eos>
 this financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit <eos>
 another $ N billion would be raised through treasury bonds which pay lower interest rates <eos>
 but the rtc also requires working capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold until the assets can be sold separately <eos>
 that debt would be paid off as the assets are sold leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ N billion or $ N billion including interest over N years <eos>
 it 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved said david <unk> executive director of the rtc <eos>
 the agency has already spent roughly $ N billion selling N insolvent s&ls and it is likely to sell or merge N by the time the bailout concludes <eos>
 <unk> other working capital he said the rtc would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets <eos>
 we would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward he said <eos>
 the complicated language in the huge new law has <unk> the fight <eos>
 the law does allow the rtc to borrow from the treasury up to $ N billion at any time <eos>
 moreover it says the rtc 's total obligations may not exceed $ N billion but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt and <unk> from it the market value of the assets the rtc holds <eos>
 but congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt say opponents of the rtc 's <unk> plan and rep. charles <unk> d. n.y said the rtc oversight board has been <unk> in not keeping congress informed <eos>
 that <unk> leads to a proposal like the one from ways and means which seems to me sort of <unk> he said <eos>
 the rtc is going to have to pay a price of prior <unk> on the hill if they want that kind of flexibility <eos>
 the ways and means committee will hold a hearing on the bill next tuesday <eos>
 we 're about to see if advertising works <eos>
 hard on the heels of friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads <unk> a familiar message keep on investing the market 's just fine <eos>
 their mission is to keep clients from <unk> the market as individual investors did in <unk> after the crash in october <eos>
 just days after the N crash major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors <eos>
 this time around they 're moving even faster <eos>
 painewebber inc. <unk> a new television commercial at N p.m. edt yesterday and had it on the air by last night <eos>
 fidelity investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday and wrote another new ad appearing today <eos>
 shearson lehman hutton inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new tv ads <eos>
 it considered running them during tomorrow night 's world series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday <eos>
 other brokerage firms including merrill lynch & co. were <unk> out potential new ad strategies <eos>
 the brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic <eos>
 this time the firms were ready <eos>
 fidelity for example prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge <eos>
 when the market went into its free fall friday afternoon the investment firm ordered full pages in the monday editions of half a dozen newspapers <eos>
 the ads touted fidelity 's automated <unk> beneath the huge headline fidelity is ready for your call <eos>
 a fidelity spokesman says the <unk> which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend <eos>
 a lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us he says <eos>
 to maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial <eos>
 it would have been too late to think about on friday <eos>
 we had to think about it ahead of time <eos>
 today 's fidelity ad goes a step further encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with fidelity <eos>
 <unk> the headline diversification it <unk> based on the events of the past week all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility <eos>
 it goes on to plug a few diversified fidelity funds by name <eos>
 painewebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the N crash <eos>
 in the aftermath of the N debacle the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night <eos>
 it also negotiated an arrangement with cable news network under which <unk> would agree to air its last-minute <unk> <eos>
 the new painewebber commercial created with ad agency saatchi & saatchi co. features mary farrell one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists <unk> particularly bullish <eos>
 taped just as the market closed yesterday it offers ms. farrell advising we view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle <eos>
 we continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation <eos>
 the spot was scheduled to appear three times on <unk> last night <eos>
 painewebber considered an even harder sell recommending specific stocks <eos>
 instead it settled on just urging the clients who are its <unk> to keep that money in the market <eos>
 we 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything which just drives the prices down further says john <unk> painewebber 's director of advertising <eos>
 if you owned it and liked it friday the true value has n't changed <eos>
 he adds this is n't N <unk> <eos>
 with the market <unk> and then closing up more than N points yesterday investment firms had to constantly revise their approach <eos>
 at shearson lehman executives created potential new commercials friday night and throughout the weekend then had to <unk> yesterday afternoon <eos>
 the plan had been to make one of shearson 's <unk> black-and-white where we stand commercials which have been running occasionally in response to news events since N <eos>
 the ad would have run during the world series tomorrow replacing the debut commercial of shearson 's new ad campaign leadership by example <eos>
 but in a meeting after the market closed yesterday shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad <eos>
 we do n't think at this point anything needs to be said <eos>
 the market seems to be <unk> out we 're taking a <unk> attitude says <unk> b. stewart executive vice president of marketing <eos>
 in any case the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of N <eos>
 but it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective <eos>
 in N despite a <unk> of ads from most of the major investment firms individuals ran from the market en <unk> <eos>
 now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around <eos>

 the team that dumped runs by the bushel on the chicago cubs in the national league playoffs was held to just one in two games by the <unk> oakland a 's the gang that had been done <unk> similarly by the los angeles <unk> and <unk> <unk> in last year 's <unk> <eos>
 <unk> much of the damage was accomplished by a 's who had some catching up to do <eos>
 in game two on a cool sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn a lot of the catching up was done by the a 's <unk> terry <unk> <eos>
 he hit a N pitch from rick <unk> into the <unk> stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from N to a decisive N where it stayed <eos>
 so what if <unk> had struck just seven home runs in N regular-season games and <unk> in the seventh position of the a 's lineup <eos>
 if you get your pitch and take a good swing anything can happen he later <unk> <eos>
 on saturday night quite a few of the boys in green and gold <unk> away successes to <unk> the pain of past and no doubt future <unk> <eos>
 mark <unk> the big <unk> oakland first <unk> had three hits in four at <unk> two more than he 'd had in the <unk> <unk> series in which he 'd gone <unk> <eos>
 the <unk> <unk> <unk> N through N <unk> the bottom of the order got seven of their team 's N hits and scored four of its runs in a N decision <eos>
 <unk> dave stewart held the giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the saturday <unk> <eos>
 that he was the a 's <unk> <unk> during its american league campaign with a N mark plus two wins over toronto in the playoffs indicates he may have some evening up coming but with the way his <unk> <unk> is <unk> that might not be this week <eos>
 the same goes for mike moore another veteran who <unk> early struggles to permit the giants but a run and four hits in seven <unk> in sunday 's contest <eos>
 every guy they put out there had a better <unk> than the guy before <unk> giant manager roger craig <eos>
 he 's an <unk> who 's one of the leading <unk> of the fashionable delivery which looks like a <unk> until it <unk> beneath the <unk> bat <eos>
 the <unk> of the <unk> is that the a 's go into san francisco 's candlestick park tonight up two games to none in the <unk> <unk> <eos>
 the <unk> to <unk> with here says that about three of four clubs N of N that took N series leads went on to win it all <eos>
 that 's not an average to <unk> giant <unk> <eos>
 one might think that the home fans in this series of the subway called bart that 's a better name for a public <unk> than desire do n't you think would have been <unk> over the proceedings but they <unk> them in relative calm <eos>
 <unk> of the two <unk> sat side by side in the <unk> seats of oakland <unk> and while they cheered their <unk> and <unk> the opposition <unk> advanced no further at least as far as i could see <eos>
 a few folks even showed up wearing <unk> bearing the colors and <unk> of both teams <eos>
 i 'm for the giants today but only because they lost yesterday <eos>
 i love <unk> both <eos>
 the only thing i 'm <unk> for is for the series to go seven games said david williams a sacramento <unk> at the <unk> before sunday 's go <eos>
 the above represents a <unk> of either <unk> or <unk> <eos>
 i choose to believe it 's the latter although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here including the a 's and giants is originally from somewhere else <eos>
 <unk> it to say that if this were a new york <unk> series or one between the chicago cubs and white <unk> <unk> it 's possible you 'd need <unk> police in every other seat to separate opposing fans and only the <unk> would <unk> their <unk> <eos>
 anyway the a 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for <eos>
 in the opening game besides <unk> and stewart there was walt weiss a <unk> <unk> <unk> who had lost a couple months of the season to <unk> surgery <eos>
 he was <unk> <unk> <unk> in game two moved a <unk> along in the a 's <unk> second inning and <unk> for his team 's final tally <eos>
 such is his reputation among the east bay <unk> that when he hit his first career home run last season the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an <unk> <eos>
 not his <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <eos>
 an a 's <unk> of the second game was <unk> henderson who <unk> the hot side of the <unk> equation <eos>
 he <unk> toronto in the playoffs with six hits seven walks and eight stolen bases in N at <unk> and continued that by going <unk> at the plate sunday along with walking stealing a base and scoring a run <eos>
 when you 're in the <unk> you see every ball <unk> he <unk> <eos>
 the cold guys in the set were will clark kevin mitchell and <unk> williams the giants ' N <unk> <eos>
 they combined for N hits six home runs and N runs <unk> in in the five games against the cubs <eos>
 they went a collective <unk> here with zero <unk> and <unk> <eos>
 it 's that last set of numbers as much as anything else that gives the giants hope in the series games to come <eos>
 i believe in the law of averages declared san francisco <unk> coach dusty baker after game two <eos>
 i 'd rather see a <unk> <unk> who 's hot come up for the other side than a good <unk> who 's cold <eos>
 but the old <unk> <unk> <unk> offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side <eos>
 when it goes you never know when you 'll get it back he said <eos>
 that 's baseball <eos>

 but as the day ended in a <unk> wall <unk> rally the city <unk> a sigh of relief <eos>
 so it went yesterday in the trading rooms of london 's financial district <eos>
 in the wake of wall street 's plunge last friday the london market was considered especially vulnerable <eos>
 and before the opening of trading here yesterday all eyes were on early trading in tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be <eos>
 by the time trading officially got under way at N a.m. the news from asia was in <eos>

 the house aviation subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major u.s. airlines <eos>
 the collapsed plan to acquire ual corp. parent of united airlines spurred quick action on the legislation introduced wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday <eos>
 the bill is expected to be taken up by the public works and transportation committee tomorrow and a floor vote by next week will be urged <eos>
 the measure drew criticism from the bush administration and a <unk> shot from financier donald trump who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for amr corp. the parent of american airlines <eos>
 in a letter to subcommittee chairman james <unk> d. minn. mr. trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for amr and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal <eos>
 <unk> <unk> deputy transportation secretary also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill in its present form <eos>
 rep. <unk> brushed off mr. trump 's allegations as an excuse for his own deal failing <eos>
 he also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from transportation secretary samuel skinner indicated there is <unk> room in the administration 's position <eos>
 mr. <unk> and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation <eos>
 but they cited the ual and amr examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation <eos>
 aides both in the house and senate said the withdrawal of the trump bid for amr is n't likely to <unk> efforts to push the legislation <eos>
 it 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it said one senate aide <eos>
 the bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out <eos>
 currently the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers but can take the drastic step of <unk> the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers <unk> <eos>
 supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and <unk> to the <unk> process and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry <eos>
 in general the bill would give the transportation department a 30-day review period before N N or more of the voting stock of a major u.s. air carrier could be acquired <eos>
 it also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition <eos>
 the bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets or give control to a foreign interest <eos>
 if more information is needed the secretary would have authority to extend the review period N days <eos>
 all the witnesses both congressmen and industry experts expressed support for the bill in order to prevent <unk> from <unk> in on airline profits at the expense of safe <unk> service <eos>
 but several committee members <unk> some backing mr. trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the ual deal and the stock-market plunge <eos>
 one of the major concerns expressed by the <unk> was that large airlines would be prohibited from <unk> themselves of smaller entities and producing independent <unk> companies <eos>
 in a possible prelude to the <unk> of talks between boeing co. and striking machinists union members a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow <eos>
 it could be a long meeting or it could be a short one said doug hammond the mediator who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a <unk> of negotiations <eos>
 we 're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that we have made no expression of expectations a boeing spokesman said <eos>
 the machinists union has rejected a three-year contract offer that would have provided a N N wage increase over the life of the pact plus some bonuses <eos>
 currently average pay for machinists is $ N an hour boeing said <eos>
 now in its 13th day the strike has <unk> about N machinists and has started to delay delivery of some <unk> <eos>
 with a strike fund of about $ N million the union had said it was prepared for a long strike <eos>
 after the third week on strike union members will begin receiving $ N a week from the fund <eos>
 work at boeing continues with supervisors and other <unk> personnel <unk> the lines <eos>

 west german economics minister helmut <unk> said in my view the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly <eos>
 there may be one or other psychological or technical reactions but they are n't based on fundamentals <eos>
 the economy of west germany and the ec european community is highly stable <eos>
 paris which has been the center of speculation fever in recent weeks also was hard hit <eos>

 frankfurt <eos>
 one of the sharpest declines came in the financial center of europe 's strongest economy <eos>
 the dax index of N west german blue chips plunged N N a one-day record <unk> out the summer 's gains <eos>
 the index closed at N down N points <eos>
 by comparison two years ago on black monday the new index would have dropped N N according to a projection by the exchange <eos>
 investors may have reacted so strongly to friday 's u.s. stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the frankfurt exchange 's losing N N of its value in the N crash and its wake <eos>
 this time however many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly <eos>
 they all went in the wrong direction said andreas <unk> an investment adviser for the bank in <unk> 's frankfurt branch <eos>
 he said he told clients to buy selected west german blue chips after they fell by about N N <eos>
 after the opening was delayed N minutes because of the crush of sell orders frankfurt 's normal <unk> trading session was extended N minutes to handle the heavy volume <eos>
 the beginning was chaotic said nigel <unk> a broker for commerzbank ag <eos>
 it took <unk> of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market <eos>
 institutional investors and bankers many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching far eastern markets were cautiously optimistic after the mild N N decline in tokyo stock prices <eos>
 everybody was still confident including most institutional investors <eos>
 that is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors said <unk> <unk> a senior trader for <unk> <unk> <eos>
 some big institutions including banks began picking up <unk> shares late yesterday but most investors wanted to see what would happen in new york before acting <eos>
 but even if wall street continues to stabilize analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the frankfurt exchange which already was showing signs of weakness after the dax had slipped from a N high of N on sept. N <eos>
 some of west germany 's <unk> chips took some of the biggest hits <eos>
 a N N drop for <unk> ag and dresdner bank ag 's N N decline were especially <unk> for their respective boards whose plans for major rights issues in november could now be in jeopardy <eos>
 dresdner bank last month said it hoped to raise N billion marks $ N million by issuing four million shares at N marks each <eos>

 the financial times-stock exchange N share index closed off N points at N its high for the day after having plunged N points at N p.m <eos>
 it was big institutions such as <unk> union insurance group scottish amicable investment managers and standard life assurance co. that <unk> the rally <eos>
 attracted by low prices and encouraged by new york 's performance they <unk> up equities across the board <eos>
 volume was N million shares more than triple recent levels <eos>
 paris <eos>
 late buying gave the paris <unk> a <unk> after its free fall early in the day <eos>
 the <unk> general index ended down N N at N a drop of N points from friday <eos>
 there was a volatility in the market that i have never seen before said <unk> <unk> a partner in brokerage firm <unk> <unk> <eos>
 when wall street turned around shortly after the opening there was panic buying in paris <eos>
 brokers said that as the news spread that wall street was moving up traders who had called to place sell orders changed their line in <unk> ordering buys instead <eos>
 trading was driven primarily by small investors and speculators with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day <eos>
 when wall street turned however the big boys entered the market looking for bargains <eos>
 j.p. morgan & co. swung to a loss in the third quarter while ncnb corp. reported net income more than doubled and security pacific corp. net rose N N <eos>
 j.p. morgan & co <eos>
 j.p. morgan as expected posted a $ N billion net loss for the quarter reflecting the new york bank 's decision last month to add $ N billion to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries <eos>
 the reserve addition placed the parent of morgan guaranty trust co. among a few major u.s. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves <eos>
 the latest quarter 's loss <unk> $ N a share <eos>
 in the year-earlier quarter morgan earned $ N million or $ N a share <eos>
 george m. <unk> analyst at prudential-bache securities inc. called the results mildly disappointing <eos>
 excluding the $ N billion provision and allowing for the taxes morgan paid earnings were about N cents a share mr. <unk> said <eos>
 in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday morgan climbed $ N a share to $ N <eos>
 net interest income sank N N in the quarter to $ N million from $ N million <eos>
 the interest rate on short-term funds which banks borrow to finance longer-term loans to customers was sharply higher morgan said <eos>
 morgan received $ N million of interest payments on its medium and long-term brazilian loans had they been <unk> interest net interest income would have been $ N million higher in the quarter morgan said <eos>
 such loans to argentina also remain classified as <unk> costing the bank $ N million of interest income in the third period <eos>
 income from sources other than interest climbed N N to $ N million reflecting higher <unk> and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities <eos>
 these increases were partly offset by lower <unk> income the bank said <eos>
 non-interest expenses grew N N to $ N million <eos>
 ncnb corp <eos>
 ncnb corp. 's net income more than doubled in the period largely because of continued strong performance by the bank 's texas operations <eos>
 the charlotte n.c. company said earnings rose to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier <eos>
 the latest quarter included a gain of $ N million or N cents a share related to the purchase of the remaining N N of ncnb texas national bank from the federal deposit insurance corp <eos>
 the strong performance however <unk> with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of ncnb 's problem loans particularly in the southeast <eos>
 in the third quarter nonperforming assets jumped to $ N million or N N of net loans and leases from $ N million or N N in the second quarter <eos>
 <unk> totaled $ N million or N N in the year-ago third quarter <eos>
 included in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $ N million loan which ncnb said it expects to be fully repaid with no loss early in the fourth quarter <eos>
 the deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of N N in ncnb 's southeast operations as well as a N N growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign <eos>
 the higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze ncnb 's net interest margin in the southeast to N N from N N a year earlier <eos>
 in big board composite trading yesterday ncnb jumped $ N a share to $ N <eos>
 results were released after the market closed <eos>
 ncnb texas national formed from the <unk> of of the failed first <unk> corp. of dallas contributed $ N million to ncnb 's bottom line in the third quarter <eos>
 ncnb said its third-quarter results reflect N N of earnings of the texas operation since aug. N <eos>
 ncnb raised some $ N billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the ncnb texas purchase and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise <eos>
 last week the banking company said it purchased both freedom savings & loan association tampa fla. and university federal savings association of san antonio texas for $ N million <eos>
 in the first nine months ncnb 's net income climbed N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier <eos>
 security pacific corp <eos>
 security pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter but the los angeles bank holding company was still able to post a N N increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans <eos>
 net rose to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier <eos>
 the company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ N million increase in net interest income reflecting a N N increase in real estate loans mainly residential and a N N rise in consumer loans <eos>
 these <unk> loans in effect replaced some <unk> assets such as <unk> loans which were allowed to decrease <eos>
 as a result security pacific 's net interest margin fell only N basis points a more mild decrease than some major banks outside california which have been reporting more sluggish earnings <eos>
 security pacific shares closed at $ N down N cents in big board composite trading <eos>
 the earnings represent a N N return on assets for security pacific and an N N return on equity <eos>
 the loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed arizona market <eos>
 security pacific reported a N N increase in net credit losses for the quarter to $ N million from $ N million in the year-ago period <eos>
 nonperforming loans grew slightly to $ N billion at sept. N from $ N billion a year ago <eos>

 non-interest expense grew only N N in the period <eos>
 for the nine months net rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier <eos>
 lin broadcasting corp. said it wo n't take a position on a revised tender offer by mccaw cellular communications inc. to buy lin and has asked for <unk> of the offer <eos>
 the new offer which seeks N N of the cellular and broadcasting concern is for $ N a share for N million lin shares <eos>
 mccaw 's revised tender offer would require mccaw to begin an auction process in july N that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of lin <eos>
 lin is asking mccaw to clarify its tender offer which challenges an agreement between bellsouth corp. and lin to merge their <unk> businesses <eos>
 bellsouth has notified lin that it would shortly respond to the mccaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is <unk> <eos>
 the lin board said holders may be <unk> by the provision in the mccaw proposal that guarantees private market value after five years for the remaining shares <eos>
 mccaw has no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain the lin board said <eos>
 the board added that mccaw would be able to control lin 's operations and could therefore operate lin in a manner which could <unk> its private market value and <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in five years <eos>

 u.s. trade representative carla hills said the first <unk> panel set up under the <unk> free trade agreement has ruled that canada 's restrictions on exports of pacific <unk> and <unk> violate the accord <eos>
 mrs. hills said the u.s. and canada have until nov. N to resolve the dispute <eos>
 if a solution is n't reached by then she said the u.s. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by u.s. <unk> companies in alaska and the pacific northwest <eos>

 questioned about the <unk> <unk> in the u.s. and canadian government views of the panel 's report an aide for mrs. hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the canadian trade restrictions are illegal <eos>
 the u.s. trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the canadian export restrictions <eos>
 canada initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought <unk> in british columbia by commercial <unk> prior to export <eos>
 this action was defended by the canadian government on conservation grounds <eos>
 mrs. hills said yesterday that the <unk> panel rejected this canadian government argument <eos>
 we fully expect that canada will comply with the panel 's ruling that the landing requirement also must be ended she said <eos>
 earlier an international panel set up under the rules of the general agreement on tariffs and trade in geneva determined that the original canadian <unk> restrictions violated gatt rules <eos>
 mrs. hills said the u.s. wo n't accept any delays after nov. N because u.s. <unk> firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season 's catch <eos>

 what happened friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently <unk> to handle another <unk> in prices <eos>
 no <unk> with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling <eos>
 but markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency <eos>
 after the N plunge markets agreed that it would be <unk> to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose <eos>
 the new york stock exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers if the dow jones index falls N points in a day the exchange will halt trading for one hour if the decline hits N points the exchange will close for an additional two hours <eos>
 the rationale is that an <unk> of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels <eos>
 it is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic <eos>
 a temporary <unk> of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself <eos>
 but there is also the possibility that <unk> down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices <eos>
 what happened friday was the worst of all <unk> <eos>
 the futures exchanges followed their own <unk> circuit breakers and shut down at about N p.m. for N minutes after the standard & poor 's N stock index had fallen N points or about N points on the dow jones index <eos>
 options markets stopped trading in many securities <eos>
 the new york stock exchange under its own rules remained open <eos>
 with nowhere else to go sellers and particularly program traders focused all their selling on the new york stock exchange <eos>
 as liquidity on that market weakened prices fell sharply <eos>
 had the futures and options markets been open additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline most probably would have been less intense <eos>
 at N after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and washington the futures exchanges reopened <eos>
 futures trading however was halted altogether at N after the futures markets had dropped an additional N points which is the daily limit for price declines <eos>
 at this point the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the new york stock exchange <eos>
 it is time to recognize that the new york stock exchange the futures markets and the options markets though <unk> separate have actually become so closely <unk> as to constitute one market effectively <eos>
 traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them <eos>
 it therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers <eos>
 to achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility either all markets should be open to trading or none <eos>
 <unk> circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on friday but they probably would have made for <unk> less volatile executions <eos>
 it 's time for the exchanges and the securities and exchange commission to agree on joint conditions for <unk> trading or staying open <eos>
 let 's not have one market shut down for N minutes when the dow declines N points and another shut down for an hour after a <unk> decline <eos>
 the need for <unk> last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that <unk> circuit breakers in all markets <eos>
 the new circuit breakers if they are to be applied at all will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the new york stock exchange remains open <eos>
 the rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies <eos>
 should the sec and the commodities futures trading commission which with the sec <unk> the chicago stock-index markets be unable to agree the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the treasury secretary <eos>
 in many ways our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago <eos>
 the new york stock exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day <eos>
 telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers and specialists who i believe should stay despite the <unk> of some post-crash critics have larger capital positions <eos>
 of course specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices <eos>
 witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early friday and opened late monday because of an excess of sell orders <eos>

 the continuing series of hud scandals is a <unk> predictable result of pork-barrel politics <eos>
 nevertheless <unk> such as the national association of home builders nahb continue to pressure capitol hill for more special-interest spending <eos>
 kent <unk> nahb executive vice president argues that the u.s. faces a <unk> housing crisis reduced <unk> of homes for first-time buyers increased homelessness and lower apartment construction rates that will be very difficult to solve without expanded federal resources <eos>
 there 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending <eos>
 but the nahb was created in N out of an organization that made its name fighting a <unk> administration proposal to take over all defense housing production <eos>
 through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer 's coalition pushing for such initiatives as the <unk> amendment <eos>
 yet on matters close to <unk> home <eos>
 the hud budget has dropped by more than N N since N argues mr. <unk> <eos>
 we 've taken more than our fair share <eos>
 i would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit <eos>
 but nahb support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch over the years the nahb has backed a host of public programs <eos>
 it once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced <unk> housing measures <eos>
 moreover explains one hud official the nahb remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production <eos>
 the association is pushing an extensive and expensive <unk> which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ N billion annually <eos>
 direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved <unk> expensive in the past and inevitably are <unk> to the benefit of <unk> developers and lobbyists as demonstrated by the ongoing hud scandal or congressmen <eos>
 indirect subsidies through the fha for instance are little better <eos>
 though mr. <unk> says expanding fha lending would result in no cost to the government the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing such as low-income to the single-family home market would result in a major expense <eos>
 more important housing programs run by hud the va and <unk> are <unk> in red ink <eos>
 the fha alone lost $ N billion in fiscal N the government 's equity in the agency essentially its reserve fund fell to minus $ N billion <eos>
 the federal government has had to pump in $ N billion into the va housing program since N to keep the fund afloat and the va requested an additional $ N million for the fiscal year just ended <eos>
 all told the federal government already guarantees more than $ N billion of mortgages <eos>
 in its <unk> produced publication where will our children live the nahb does acknowledge that of course the full measure of housing <unk> can not be provided by the federal government <eos>
 it points to the <unk> impact of local government regulation particularly <unk> and building fees which <unk> the price of housing out of the reach of <unk> and <unk> people <eos>
 but while the nahb has suggested actions that states and <unk> should take to reduce regulatory barriers the association has proposed no activist legislative program comparable to say its detailed request for more federal subsidies to eliminate <unk> controls <eos>
 the association a majority of whose N members build fewer than N units a year is like many other business <unk> <eos>
 explains <unk> macdonald of the national taxpayers union it <unk> in two <unk> <eos>
 the builders like the subsidies but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues such as the <unk> amendment <eos>
 unfortunately the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility <eos>
 two years ago when the nahb lobbied for the $ N billion omnibus housing bill the organization basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition says ms. macdonald <eos>
 as mr. <unk> of the nahb acknowledges government is not going to solve the problem <eos>
 the real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down <eos>
 more money for hud will increase the deficit and <unk> the economy more money to municipalities that are <unk> their local housing markets will further <unk> them from the <unk> effects of their policies <eos>
 is this what the home builders want <eos>

 in an attempt to give new momentum to european community plans for a single currency ec government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on <unk> the ec 's founding treaty of rome <eos>

 the latest <unk> in the equities markets <unk> me of the joke t. boone pickens tells about the guy who was run over by the parade <eos>
 when asked what went wrong the unfortunate victim replied it was a combination of things <eos>
 and so it was on gray friday <eos>
 the grand <unk> of this parade would appear to have been excess leverage <eos>
 even if that is so however it 's probably the case that no barriers should have been <unk> to stop the <unk> before the end of the rout e <eos>
 the <unk> began friday afternoon when word spread that the ual buy-out was <unk> <eos>
 although the <unk> expects to patch together a substitute offer consisting of less cash the failure to get cash from japanese and american banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the <unk> of <unk> takeover deals is ending <eos>
 lots of other <unk> made up the parade of course notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices <unk> federal reserve <unk> and the bush administration 's temporary defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax <eos>
 as usual few favorable reviews were heard for that <unk> <unk> band of program traders although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write <eos>
 what really spooked the <unk> along wall street however was the sudden concern that whatever the reason the pool of debt capital is <unk> up <eos>
 gray friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers rather than the small investor as their highly <unk> investments in the deal stocks are <unk> by the unexpected <unk> up of the <unk> for deal financing <eos>
 deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses <eos>
 ual which triggered the slide opened monday at $ N down about N N from thursday 's close <eos>
 amr opened monday at $ N down nearly N N from thursday 's close <eos>
 both took further hits yesterday <eos>

 a careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured the target 's stock price was not affected on friday <eos>
 the multibillion-dollar prospects where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks <unk> issue billions in high-yield debt were where the damage was concentrated <eos>
 the market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for friday 's dramatic march for several weeks <eos>
 the growing financial difficulties of recent <unk> restructurings or takeovers such as resorts international integrated resources and campeau 's retailing empire have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities <eos>
 investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by ohio <unk> and by forcing ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring <eos>
 as a result high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ N billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times <eos>
 these are all market excesses putting aside the <unk> boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity and what we 've seen is the market <unk> them in <eos>
 of course washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle and its tendency to <unk> in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect but those preliminary steps should n't <unk> us from the basic market <unk> that was at work on friday <eos>
 if it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and lbos caused gray friday what are the implications for policy makers <eos>
 after all the stock market 's response to the collapse of the ual deal might be taken to confirm the <unk> direction of regulators <eos>
 is this a case where private markets are <unk> of washington 's <unk> of wall street <eos>
 absolutely not <eos>
 to the extent that friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden <unk> of the excesses of leverage the message is that wall street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior <eos>
 the national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various lbo deals and leveraged restructurings <eos>
 the recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the <unk> of bank capital for recent deals <unk> the wisdom of letting the free markets operate <eos>
 if takeover premiums become excessive if lbo <unk> become too aggressive then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers and the markets will move with <unk> speed to impose appropriate sanctions <eos>
 yes the broader exchanges got caught up in the <unk> but they rode the tiger up all year <eos>
 not surprisingly he sometimes <unk> <eos>
 the arbitragers and takeover <unk> got killed on gray friday while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered <unk> <eos>
 if you identify with the besieged managers you must concede that <unk> and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from washington <eos>
 if you side with the arbitragers and raiders you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators although the delaware courts should never be underestimated <eos>
 the truth is washington understands politics better than economics <eos>
 although the average citizen is probably not <unk> too much from washington 's <unk> war against wall street regarding excessive financial <unk> actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm <eos>
 any such attempt to <unk> good debt from bad debt or to draw the line at a particular industry such as the airlines is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general <eos>

 tokyo share prices rebounded tuesday morning with the nikkei index of N selected stocks rising N points to close the morning session at N <eos>
 the index slid N points or N N on monday <eos>
 in the first N minutes of tuesday 's trading the nikkei index soared N points to N <eos>
 by N a.m. tokyo time the index was up N points to N as investors hailed new york 's overnight rally <eos>
 monday 's slide came in a relatively calm session that did n't provide much direction for other markets <eos>
 shares also closed sharply lower across europe particularly in frankfurt although london and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in new york <eos>
 other asian and pacific markets had sharper losses than tokyo but the selling wave stopped short of <unk> another market crash <eos>
 all eyes were on tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market to trade since friday 's 190.58-point plunge on wall street <eos>
 but rather than set the tone for other markets japan 's major institutional investors chose to remain on the sidelines <eos>
 still despite the sudden <unk> of stock-market turbulence managers of japanese investment funds said they were n't planning to unload u.s. or european equities <eos>
 we did n't trade much today as our policy now is to wait and see said a fund manager at <unk> life insurance co <eos>
 we would like to wait and see until trading goes around through europe and new york <eos>
 the institutions appeared confident that japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary and there was considerable speculation during the day that the finance ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that <eos>
 but in the absence of <unk> trading its presence was never <unk> felt <eos>
 at the close the nikkei average of N stocks stood at N down N points or N N <eos>
 the broader tokyo stock price index sank N or N N to N <eos>
 the day 's decline was generally in line with analysts ' weekend predictions <eos>
 declining issues <unk> advancers N <eos>
 but volume was thin at N million shares compared with N million friday <eos>
 the market opened sharply lower with the nikkei average down nearly N after N minutes <eos>
 a midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about N at the end of the morning session but the rally failed in the afternoon and the market closed near the day 's low <eos>
 the smaller stocks in the tokyo market 's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year <eos>
 the tokyo stock exchange index for the second section fell N or N N to N <eos>
 many investors trying to outperform the market 's major indexes have <unk> to these small issues in recent weeks <eos>
 japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the tokyo market did n't fall more sharply <eos>
 but its performance did bear some <unk> to events of two years ago during the october N global stock market crash <eos>
 on oct. N N the friday before the black monday crash the new york market dropped N N and tokyo followed on monday with a N N drop <eos>
 this time wall street 's plunge of N N friday was followed by yesterday 's N N loss in tokyo <eos>
 two years ago tokyo 's biggest fall came the day after new york 's N N black monday plunge when the nikkei average fell N N <eos>
 thus market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to wall street 's opening <eos>
 but in new york yesterday the dow jones industrial average surged N to close at N on heavy volume of N shares although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market <eos>
 <unk> <unk> a director at yamaichi investment trust & management co. called yesterday 's session a good scenario for japan <eos>
 now we are looking for the time to place buy orders he said <eos>
 for us institutional investors the chance for buying has come <eos>
 <unk> <unk> general manager of the investment research department at <unk> trust & banking co. also was optimistic <eos>
 he described friday 's plunge in the u.s. as a fleeting event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity <eos>
 unless there is a panic this is the best time to buy as was the case two years ago he said <eos>
 those shares which had posted gains on <unk> speculation were dashed with cold water but as far as major stocks are concerned there is n't much impact <eos>
 other fund managers were similarly <unk> <eos>
 we have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities said <unk> <unk> chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at <unk> trust & banking co <eos>

 <unk> manila seoul taipei and <unk> escaped with slightly smaller losses <eos>
 brokers and fund managers said the region 's markets were reacting to friday 's wall street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy-outs and a deteriorating junk-bond market <eos>
 it 's pure psychology said william <unk> <unk> an account executive for drexel burnham lambert <unk> ltd. in hong kong <eos>
 markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged buy-outs and their economies generally are in good shape but there 's no doubt that asia is still following america 's lead <eos>
 several analysts said malaysia and singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows <eos>
 hong kong is the region 's next most open market but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in june amid political turmoil in china <eos>
 singapore took the hit because when people want to get out they tend to go where the liquidity is said elizabeth hambrecht a regional analyst with baring securities hong kong ltd <eos>
 she pointed out that even after monday 's N N decline the <unk> times index is up N N this year so investors who <unk> out generally did so profitably <eos>
 similarly kuala lumpur 's composite index yesterday ended N N above its N close <eos>
 in hong kong the hang seng index fell N to finish at N <eos>
 trading was heavy at about one billion shares compared with N million friday <eos>
 but the session was orderly in contrast to the market 's four-day <unk> after the N crash <eos>
 richard <unk> a director at hong <unk> baring international fund managers ltd. said the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close <eos>
 if new york does n't collapse i see maybe another N N on the downside not counting the risk of bad news out of china he said <eos>

 frank lloyd wright is reported to have said once that if you <unk> the world on its side everything loose would end up in california <eos>
 we 've always thought that mr. wright underestimated california 's <unk> but maybe the state 's <unk> <unk> are starting to <unk> the forces that made it such a significant place <eos>
 what else is one to make of the <unk> <unk> initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general <eos>
 if passed by the voters the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides reduce carbon dioxide emissions by N N ban new offshore drilling ban chemicals thought to <unk> the ozone layer and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $ N million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too <unk> <eos>
 the initiative is based largely on the <unk> of the green lobby the sierra club the league of conservation voters the natural resources defense council the national <unk> campaign and the citizens for a better environment <eos>
 <unk> the environmental defense fund is having nothing to do with this one <eos>
 not only californians but all americans would pay if this thing passed <eos>
 the initiative bars the sale of any crops in california that do n't meet the initiative 's standards <eos>
 kansas wheat farmers and florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the california market <eos>
 in other words california is <unk> to take control of the nation 's farm policy <eos>
 as usual the green lobby 's proposal is <unk> from scientific reality <eos>
 consider the <unk> provision <eos>
 the proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of N N <eos>
 even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory it is <unk> that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem <eos>
 but if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative what is going on <eos>
 the first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit <eos>
 the key here is the <unk> of state attorney general john van de <unk> <eos>
 he 's running for governor <eos>
 mr. van de <unk> is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and <unk> them into a single <unk> initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on nov. N N <eos>
 that 's also the day of the gubernatorial election <eos>
 the initiative seems to have been <unk> to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy hollywood <unk> who <unk> money <eos>
 and it allows mr. van de <unk> to get around campaign spending limits <eos>
 he can spend the legal maximum for his campaign all the spending for the van de <unk> initiative on which there are no limits is <unk> <eos>
 this initiative is being labeled the big green but maybe it should be called the big <unk> <eos>
 the republican candidate sen. pete wilson is playing the initiative <unk> game too <unk> his own crime initiative <eos>
 while it is possible that the big green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional it is of course <unk> that in modern california it could slide through <eos>
 this is the state that recently passed the <unk> N <unk> initiative <eos>
 if this new proposal ever does become law the green lobby will benefit directly <eos>
 the initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like <eos>
 that means the <unk> and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation taxpayers would bear the cost <eos>
 mr. van de <unk> and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and <unk> issue among certain segments of california 's population now that almost any collection of <unk> <unk> nonsense can pass under its <unk> <eos>
 of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation <unk> themselves <eos>
 george bush for example may decide that he does n't want to be the president who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from california <eos>
 and some other segments of california 's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs <eos>
 this <unk> initiative will help california define itself for the future either as a state still <unk> to economic and scientific reality or as one being led to wherever its <unk> activists want to take it <eos>
 first there was a death watch <eos>
 then <unk> <eos>
 spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks the dow jones industrial average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of friday 's 190.58-point plunge gaining N to N <eos>
 it was the <unk> advance for the average of N blue chips on <unk> new york stock exchange volume of N shares the highest since the days after the N crash <eos>
 while the advance cheered investors who feared a <unk> crash would occur yesterday it was strictly a <unk> rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders <eos>
 a troubling sign declining stocks on the big board outnumbered advancers N to N and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of friday 's late big board plunge <eos>

 <unk> plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks ual and amr which each fell more than N N when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended friday afternoon <eos>
 ual the takeover stock at the center of friday 's 190.58-point market plunge fell N N to N N on nearly N million shares <eos>
 overall this is a <unk> rally but it 's very selective said arthur <unk> jr. a veteran painewebber inc. trader at the big board <eos>
 everyone was a little concerned about the general <unk> of the rally and failure of the otc market to get into plus territory <eos>
 it 's just a strange feeling <eos>
 i do n't think anyone left the place <unk> <unk> <eos>
 the rally gave <unk> at least for now to the <unk> declaration of big board chairman john j. phelan jr. that friday 's market debacle was an <unk> condition and not a disaster <eos>
 but to traders it looked like disaster on the N a.m. opening bell <eos>
 the dow jones industrial average opened down N shortly after N <eos>
 but most of the N blue-chip stocks in the average including eastman kodak and general motors could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from friday 's <unk> rout <eos>
 at N procter & gamble one of the most important dow <unk> of late opened down N N to N <eos>
 the dow dropped to a quick <unk> loss and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble <eos>

 there was heavy stock-index arbitrage as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets <eos>
 this was a <unk> from friday when standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks <eos>
 the <unk> of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized <eos>
 they did n't <eos>
 the dow accelerated its slide losing N in the first N minutes of trading <eos>
 with program traders seemingly in charge buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall <eos>
 then at N the dow suddenly started to rebound and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the <unk> fall <eos>
 and this time it was n't just the program traders who were responsible <eos>
 all the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily <eos>
 the program traders were in there too of course <eos>
 but according to one trader the programmers did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was also a lot of bargain-hunting by institutions <eos>

 the <unk> on the chicago board options exchange the nation 's major options market was heavy after the trading in s&p N stock-index options was halted friday <eos>

 this time institutions saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away <eos>
 then when the market was at a technical level to buy they came in with a <unk> <eos>
 however according to one analyst the timing of major market index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of terrible tuesday <eos>

 merck is one of the most important stocks in the major market index <eos>

 mr. phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months <eos>
 some N million of the more than N million shares traded in the final N minutes of friday 's session when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated were <unk> he said <eos>
 program trades make up N N of the exchange 's volume on an average day but despite the increase friday it was certainly not something you would say <unk> the market decline mr. phelan said <eos>

 the institutions ca n't be criticized for their behavior mr. dapuzzo said in an interview <eos>
 it was the opposite of what happened on oct. N <eos>
 they used their judgment <eos>
 they did n't panic during the first round of selling this morning <eos>
 instead they bought on weakness and sold into the strength which kept the market orderly <eos>
 maybe they learned from experience <eos>

 a house-senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental u.s. and on all flights of six hours or less to alaska and hawaii <eos>
 the restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less <eos>
 the exemption allowed on longer flights to alaska and hawaii appears to be largely a <unk> <unk> for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years <eos>
 by a N margin house negotiators initially rejected last night a senate provision covering all domestic flights <eos>
 but the <unk> compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions <eos>
 as a practical matter flights from the west coast to hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit but the language would exempt longer routes beginning for example in chicago or on the east coast <eos>
 within the senate the ban has had aggressive support from sen. frank <unk> d. n.j. who has used his position as a senate appropriations subcommittee chairman to <unk> votes for the initiative <eos>
 the measure is attached to the more than $ N billion fiscal N transportation bill within mr. <unk> 's jurisdiction and the final compromise is <unk> with more than $ N million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports including denver <eos>
 from the outset the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow <eos>
 but the industry retains support in the house leadership through the influence of grower states such as north carolina <eos>
 majority whip william gray owes a political debt to southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the house and the philadelphia democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban <eos>
 although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest the underlying bill was the subject of <unk> lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane but politically important projects of members <eos>
 in a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees the house deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in florida illinois and pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the house floor <eos>

 within the federal aviation administration the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than N N from last year and total operations would rise to $ N billion a N N boost <eos>
 the facilities account includes $ N million for denver 's ambitious new airport and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in philadelphia and michigan and the major carriers to denver united and continental <eos>
 leery of the costs and critics say competition the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of denver <eos>
 texas air corp. which owns continental and the air transport association were prominent in the lobbying <eos>
 the industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for N N of the gates <eos>
 but this was rejected in favor of much <unk> language <unk> the transportation department to review the costs of the first phase expected to cost about $ N billion <eos>
 though smaller in total dollars the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $ N million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports <eos>
 the sum is more than double what the house had approved for the program but the list of qualified airports would be cut by N under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy <eos>
 congress previously cut six airports this year <eos>
 the impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $ N for each passenger in subsidies <eos>
 among rail and highway accounts the agreement provides $ N million for <unk> including $ N million for capital improvements <eos>

 the sudden flight to quality that triggered friday 's explosive <unk> rally was reversed yesterday in a flight from quality rout <eos>
 the setback in which treasury bond prices plummeted reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit-taking <eos>
 it was a pretty wild day <eos>
 our markets were closely tied to the stock market said joel <unk> manager of trading at smith barney harris upham & co <eos>
 friday 's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its <unk> he said <eos>
 some fixed-income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly <unk> drop in the dow jones industrial average on friday <eos>
 that caused investors to <unk> stocks and buy high-quality treasury bonds which are safer than other types of securities <eos>
 but when stocks began to climb instead prices of treasury bonds declined <eos>

 junk bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed <eos>
 some traders said the high-yield market was helped by active institutional buying <eos>
 in particular they said firms such as first boston corp. and drexel burnham lambert inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels <eos>

 black-and-white film costs consumers a little less than color film and processing costs the same <eos>
 but for <unk> developing costs for black-and-white film are higher <eos>

 while friday 's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy 's prospects a <unk> indicator that has <unk> <unk> the economy 's ups and <unk> by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity <eos>
 the barometer developed by analysts at columbia university 's center for international business cycle research here reached a record high of N in august the latest month available and the columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then <eos>
 the latest reading of N was up from N in july and N as recently as march <eos>
 the august rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator which uses the N average as a base of N <eos>
 in contrast the commerce department 's widely followed index of leading indicators while up in august has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year <eos>
 its <unk> behavior through much of N has prompted some <unk> to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end <eos>
 but the far stronger showing of the columbia index makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely says <unk> h. moore the director of the columbia facility <eos>
 a leading authority on the business cycle mr. moore also is a member of the business cycle dating group the panel of private economists that decides for the government when <unk> and recessions begin and end <eos>
 the group normally <unk> only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely <eos>
 no meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks mr. moore reports <eos>
 based largely on the recent strength in their index called the long leading indicator the columbia analysts <unk> <unk> economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well <eos>
 they expect a N N rise in N in the gross national product after adjustment for inflation <eos>
 underlying this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or <unk> as the case may be by substantially greater periods than the commerce department 's index of leading indicators <eos>
 over the full <unk> war ii era the columbia index on the average has entered sustained declines N months before the <unk> of recessions and turned up eight months before <unk> <eos>
 the comparable lead times for the commerce index whose components include the stock market are far shorter N months before recessions and only three months before <unk> <eos>
 the columbia economists also have <unk> how the long leading index would have behaved had it existed in N before the stock market crash in october that <unk> in the great depression <eos>
 the indicator reached a peak in january N and then fell steadily up to and through the crash <eos>
 it was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now mr. moore says <eos>
 a major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the dow jones corporate <unk> index which is not a part of the commerce index <eos>
 in august the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early N <eos>
 it also rose last friday while the stock market sagged <eos>
 other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries the <unk> version of the money supply adjusted for inflation and the volume of new <unk> permits <eos>
 notably <unk> from the columbia index is the stock market which mr. moore says is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's <unk> prospects though it still is useful for anticipating some <unk> <unk> and turns <eos>
 as recently as N the stock market as reflected in the standard & poor 's index of N common stocks was rated by the national bureau of economic research as the best of the N leading indicators that then made up the commerce index <eos>
 it was assigned a mark of N out of a possible N compared with scores ranging as low as N for the other components <eos>
 the stock market has lost some <unk> power analysts at the columbia center claim because of the growing impact of international developments <eos>
 stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy mr. moore says citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets the <unk> balance and inflows of foreign capital <eos>
 he also feels that the rise of such <unk> practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's <unk> to the economic outlook <eos>

 an american journalist now is standing trial in namibia <eos>
 this is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over in the expectation that it 's going to hold an election <eos>
 the most likely winner will be the <unk> swapo rebels <eos>
 the u.s. journalist 's crime was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election 's fairness <unk> <unk> was openly sympathetic to swapo <eos>
 shortly after that mr. <unk> had scott stanley arrested and his <unk> confiscated <eos>
 mr. stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a <unk> issued by the south african administrator general earlier this year which made it a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to <unk> <unk> or <unk> the election commission <eos>
 the stanley affair does n't <unk> well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in namibia when swapo starts running the government <eos>
 to the extent mr. stanley has done anything wrong it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the <unk> guerrillas were above all else the victims of <unk> by neighboring south africa <eos>
 swapo has enjoyed favorable western media treatment ever since the u.n. general assembly declared it the sole <unk> representative of namibia 's people in <eos>
 last year the u.s. <unk> a peace settlement to remove cuba 's <unk> <unk> from <unk> and hold free and fair elections that would end south africa 's control of namibia <eos>

 he interviewed mr. <unk> head of a commission charged with investigating electoral <unk> and reported that mr. <unk> was openly sympathetic to swapo and indeed had defended its leaders in court <eos>
 after mr. stanley 's article was published in two <unk> newspapers mr. <unk> had criminal charges brought against their editors publisher and lawyer <eos>
 mr. stanley was arrested and charged along with the others when he returned to namibia this month <eos>
 both the state department and the lawyers committee for freedom of the press have <unk> mr. stanley 's <unk> <eos>
 mr. stanley 's arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that threaten to <unk> namibia 's elections <eos>
 both south african and swapo <unk> are <unk> voters <eos>
 the u.s. is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then <unk> its hands over the <unk> results <eos>
 it now has the chance to <unk> that record in namibia <eos>
 state and the human-rights community should insist that mr. stanley and his fellow defendants be released and that the united nation 's monitors make certain that mr. <unk> commission <unk> election complaints from all sides <eos>

 crude oil declined early but as the stock market retained early gains it too became stronger ending with a small net loss <eos>
 trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines <eos>
 in chicago grain and soybean prices rose slightly <eos>

 one analyst peter <unk> of <unk> & co. new york said the gold market already had some good <unk> technical factors that would have caused prices to rise with or without the stock market <eos>
 what the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened said mr. <unk> <eos>
 there 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further he said <eos>
 he expects a drop in interest rates which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising <eos>
 finally according to mr. <unk> the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the august merchandise trade deficit when the figures are released today <eos>
 this would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold he said <eos>

 worried that friday 's 190-point stock market plunge might be a <unk> of things to come for the economy petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices <eos>
 the u.s. benchmark crude west texas intermediate closed at $ N a barrel for november delivery down N cents <eos>

 until yesterday futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong <eos>
 the organization of petroleum exporting countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand <eos>

 the december contract declined N cents a pound to $ N <eos>

 highland valley is a large canadian producer and principal supplier to japan which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank <eos>
 last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle the contracting out of work by the company <eos>

 it was simply <unk> he said and selling by funds that are computer <unk> helped depress prices <eos>

 however after <unk> the potential effect of the hurricane prices began to slip late friday mr. simon said <eos>
 that selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure he said <eos>

 india recently bought N tons and was expected to buy more the analyst said <eos>
 another analyst thought that india may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market <eos>
 india may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar it could buy at lower prices said <unk> <unk> analyst for shearson lehman hutton new york <eos>
 at any rate she added india needs the sugar so it will be in sooner or later to buy it <eos>

 chicago investor william <unk> agreed to sell three divisions of cluett peabody & co. for about $ N million to <unk> s.a. a closely held clothing maker based in paris <eos>
 shortly after completing the $ N billion acquisition of west <unk> inc. in april mr. <unk> 's holding company <unk> inc. said it was considering the sale of cluett a leading <unk> maker and one of west <unk> 's biggest units <eos>
 included in the sale are cluett units that make men 's shirts under the arrow name <unk> under the gold <unk> name and <unk> through the <unk> division <eos>
 the companies said the agreement is subject to <unk> 's <unk> of financing and to regulatory and other approvals <eos>
 they said the sale is expected to be concluded by the end of november <eos>
 mr. <unk> said the sale of three of cluett 's four main divisions plus other anticipated west <unk> asset sales by december should bring in a total of about $ N million <eos>
 he did n't elaborate on other asset sales being considered <eos>
 mr. <unk> followed a similar pattern when he acquired northwest industries inc. and then sold much of its assets <eos>

 britain 's blue arrow plc intends to change its name to manpower plc and write off a chunk of the nearly $ N billion in good will realized in the takeover of <unk> manpower inc <eos>
 blue arrow chairman mitchell fromstein said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to <unk> the world 's biggest <unk> group in the u.s. <eos>
 mr. fromstein disclosed the planned steps expected within a few months as blue arrow posted a N N drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings <eos>
 the name change and good will write-off could help <unk> blue arrow 's dominance of the u.s. <unk> market and give it a more american image as u.s. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after friday 's market plunge <eos>
 u.s. holders now own more than N N of blue arrow compared with N N last january <eos>
 in the u.s. market the recognition of the manpower name is <unk> stronger than blue arrow mr. fromstein said <eos>
 the moves also could <unk> shareholders ' perception of blue arrow as a company in turmoil <eos>
 it further <unk> the concept that blue arrow is a thing of the past said doug arthur an analyst at kidder peabody & co. in new york <eos>
 the proposed changes all make a lot of sense to me he added <eos>
 in a widely publicized <unk> coup mr. fromstein ousted <unk> berry as blue arrow chief executive in january a month after mr. berry had forced mr. fromstein out as the $ N <unk> chief of <unk> manpower <eos>
 mr. fromstein <unk> his control in april by taking over from mr. berry as chairman <eos>
 but the blue arrow <unk> is n't over yet as the british government is investigating a disputed # N million $ N million loan which mr. fromstein has said was made under mr. berry 's direction <eos>
 blue arrow was able to pull off the $ N billion takeover of manpower in N largely because different british and american accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for british companies <eos>
 under british rules blue arrow was able to write off at once the $ N billion in good will arising from the purchase <eos>
 as a <unk> company blue arrow would have to <unk> the good will over as many as N years creating a continuing drag on reported earnings <eos>
 good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets <eos>
 but with so many shares now held in the u.s. blue arrow reports its earnings two ways based on both u.k. and u.s. accounting standards <eos>
 our balance sheets look like they came from alice 's <unk> mr. fromstein said <eos>
 the british version shows a handful of pounds of net worth following the N write-off of good will while the american version reflects $ N billion of net worth because almost none of the good will has been written off <eos>
 mr. fromstein said he hopes to <unk> some of the good will left on blue arrow 's u.s. books in one fell <unk> but would n't specify how much <eos>
 people close to blue arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk with executives claiming prior management <unk> the extent of manpower 's good will <eos>
 that move along with the return to the manpower name could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help <eos>
 the number of u.s. temporary workers fell about N N in the N months ending aug. N after sliding nearly N N in july said kidder peabody 's mr. arthur <eos>
 blue arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended july N partly on slower earnings growth of <unk> units in britain <eos>
 overall pretax profit slid to # N million in the quarter from # N million a year earlier <eos>
 richard g. sim the man credited with <unk> applied power inc. from an <unk> into a <unk> player in the global market for <unk> tools hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company 's latest acquisition barry wright corp <eos>
 the 45-year-old former general electric co. executive figures it will be easier this time <eos>
 but analysts while <unk> the acquisition say applied 's chief executive faces a tough challenge in <unk> the two companies <eos>
 barry wright acquired by applied for $ N million makes <unk> equipment and <unk> systems <eos>
 the <unk> mass. company 's sales have been <unk> and its profits have dropped <eos>
 last year 's earnings of $ N million including $ N from a restructuring gain were far below the year-earlier $ N million <eos>
 besides spurring barry wright 's sales which were $ N million in N mr. sim must <unk> its costs and product line <eos>
 the question is how long it 's going to take barry wright to make a contribution says f. john <unk> an analyst at blunt ellis <unk> in milwaukee <eos>
 the answer will help determine whether applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by mr. sim <eos>
 the butler wis. manufacturer went public at $ N a share in august N and mr. sim 's goal then was a $ N per-share price by N <eos>
 strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule in august N <eos>
 the stock has since <unk> trading around $ N a share last week and closing yesterday at $ N in national over-the-counter trading <eos>
 but mr. sim has set a fresh target of $ N a share by the end of <eos>
 reaching that goal says robert t. <unk> applied 's chief financial officer will require efficient reinvestment of cash by applied and <unk> of its healthy N N rate of return on operating capital <eos>
 in barry wright mr. sim sees a situation very similar to the one he faced when he joined applied as president and chief operating officer in N <eos>
 applied then a closely held company was <unk> under the management of its controlling family <eos>
 while profitable it was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital he says <eos>
 mr. sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at barry wright as it has at applied <eos>
 he also <unk> an <unk> <unk> to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where <unk> is shared <eos>
 mr. sim considers the new unit 's operations fundamentally sound and adds that barry wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors <eos>
 with a little patience these businesses will perform very <unk> mr. sim says <eos>
 within about six months things will be moving in the right direction he predicts <eos>
 mr. sim figures it will be easier to turn barry wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat <eos>
 when he came to applied i did n't have the power to execute as i do today he says <eos>
 he was named chief executive officer of applied in N and became chairman last november <eos>
 at applied mr. sim set growth as his first objective <eos>
 he took the company public in an offering that <unk> applied about $ N million which helped launch the company 's acquisition program <eos>
 sales climbed to an estimated $ N million in fiscal N ended aug. N from $ N million in fiscal N <eos>
 the company expects that earnings which have marched steadily upward in recent years reached about $ N million or $ N a share in the fiscal year just ended up from $ N million in fiscal N and $ N million in N <eos>
