 no it was n't black monday <eos>
 but while the new york stock exchange did n't fall apart friday as the dow jones industrial average plunged N points most of it in the final hour it barely managed to stay this side of chaos <eos>
 some circuit breakers installed after the october N crash failed their first test traders say unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures <eos>
 the N stock specialist firms on the big board floor the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the N crash once again could n't handle the selling pressure <eos>
 big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor traders by buying big blocks of stock traders say <eos>

 the <unk> has already begun <eos>
 the equity market was <unk> <eos>
 once again the specialists were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the new york stock exchange said christopher <unk> senior vice president at <unk> securities corp <eos>

 speculators are calling for a degree of liquidity that is not there in the market <eos>
 many money managers and some traders had already left their offices early friday afternoon on a warm autumn day because the stock market was so quiet <eos>
 then in a <unk> plunge the dow jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year <unk> up a 190.58-point or N N loss on the day in <unk> trading volume <eos>
 <unk> trading accelerated to N million shares a record for the big board <eos>
 at the end of the day N million shares were traded <eos>
 the dow jones industrials closed at N <eos>
 the dow 's decline was second in point terms only to the <unk> black monday crash that occurred oct. N N <eos>
 in percentage terms however the dow 's dive was the <unk> ever and the sharpest since the market fell N or N N a week after black monday <eos>
 the dow fell N N on black monday <eos>
 shares of ual the parent of united airlines were extremely active all day friday reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $ N billion buy-out of the airline by an <unk> group <eos>
 wall street 's takeover-stock speculators or risk arbitragers had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and ual stock would rise <eos>
 at N p.m. edt came the <unk> news the big board was <unk> trading in ual pending news <eos>
 on the exchange floor as soon as ual stopped trading we <unk> for a panic said one top floor trader <eos>
 several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news <unk> <eos>
 for weeks the market had been nervous about takeovers after campeau corp. 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers <eos>
 and N minutes after the ual trading halt came news that the ual group could n't get financing for its bid <eos>
 at this point the dow was down about N points <eos>
 the market <unk> <eos>
 arbitragers could n't dump their ual stock but they rid themselves of nearly every rumor stock they had <eos>
 for example their selling caused trading halts to be declared in usair group which closed down N N to N N delta air lines which fell N N to N N and <unk> industries which sank N to N N <eos>
 these stocks eventually reopened <eos>
 but as panic spread speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as philip morris and international business machines to offset their losses <eos>
 when trading was halted in philip morris the stock was trading at N down N N while ibm closed N N lower at N <eos>
 selling <unk> because of waves of automatic stop-loss orders which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels <eos>
 most of the stock selling pressure came from wall street professionals including computer-guided program traders <eos>
 traders said most of their major institutional investors on the other hand sat tight <eos>
 now at N one of the market 's post-crash reforms took hold as the s&p N futures contract had plunged N points equivalent to around a <unk> drop in the dow industrials <eos>
 under an agreement signed by the big board and the chicago mercantile exchange trading was temporarily halted in chicago <eos>
 after the trading halt in the s&p N pit in chicago waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the big board and specialists continued to <unk> prices down <eos>
 as a result the link between the futures and stock markets <unk> apart <eos>
 without the <unk> of stock-index futures the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the big board <eos>
 the futures halt was even <unk> by big board floor traders <eos>
 it <unk> things up said one major specialist <eos>
 this confusion effectively halted one form of program trading stock index arbitrage that closely links the futures and stock markets and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings <eos>
 in a stock-index arbitrage sell program traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference <eos>
 when the airline information came through it <unk> every model we had for the marketplace said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms <eos>
 we did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do <eos>
 but stocks kept falling <eos>
 the dow industrials were down N points at N p.m. before the <unk> halt <eos>
 at N p.m. at the end of the cooling off period the average was down N points <eos>
 meanwhile during the the s&p trading halt s&p futures sell orders began <unk> up while stocks in new york kept falling sharply <eos>
 big board chairman john j. phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker worked well <unk> <eos>
 i just think it 's <unk> at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things <eos>
 under another post-crash system big board president richard <unk> mr. phelan was flying to <unk> as the market was falling was talking on an <unk> hot line to the other exchanges the securities and exchange commission and the federal reserve board <eos>
 he <unk> out at a high-tech <unk> center on the floor of the big board where he could watch <unk> on prices and pending stock orders <eos>
 at about N p.m. edt s&p futures resumed trading and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line <eos>
 buyers stepped in to the futures pit <eos>
 but the <unk> of s&p futures sell orders weighed on the market and the link with stocks began to fray again <eos>
 at about N the s&p market <unk> to still another limit of N points down and trading was locked again <eos>
 futures traders say the s&p was <unk> that the dow could fall as much as N points <eos>
 during this time small investors began ringing their brokers wondering whether another crash had begun <eos>
 at prudential-bache securities inc. which is trying to cater to small investors some <unk> brokers thought this would be the final <unk> <eos>
 that 's when george l. ball chairman of the prudential insurance co. of america unit took to the internal <unk> system to declare that the plunge was only mechanical <eos>
 i have a <unk> that this particular decline today is something more <unk> about less <eos>
 it would be my <unk> to advise clients not to sell to look for an opportunity to buy mr. ball told the brokers <eos>
 at merrill lynch & co. the nation 's biggest brokerage firm a news release was prepared <unk> merrill lynch comments on market drop <eos>
 the release cautioned that there are significant differences between the current environment and that of october N and that there are still attractive investment opportunities in the stock market <eos>
 however jeffrey b. lane president of shearson lehman hutton inc. said that friday 's plunge is going to set back relations with customers because it <unk> the concern of volatility <eos>
 and i think a lot of people will <unk> on program trading <eos>
 it 's going to bring the debate right back to the <unk> <eos>
 as the dow average ground to its final N loss friday the s&p pit stayed locked at its <unk> trading limit <eos>
 jeffrey <unk> of program trader <unk> investment group said N s&p contracts were for sale on the close the equivalent of $ N million in stock <eos>
 but there were no buyers <eos>
 while friday 's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning traders said <eos>
 stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself <eos>
 at those levels stocks are set up to be <unk> by index arbitragers who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall and simultaneously sell off stocks <eos>
 but nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today <eos>
 the <unk> between the stock and futures markets friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether wall street is properly prepared for another crash situation <eos>
 the big board 's mr. <unk> said our <unk> performance was good <eos>
 but the exchange will look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks <eos>
 obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the <unk> obligations were n't met he said <eos>

 but specialists complain privately that just as in the N crash the <unk> firms big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock stayed on the sidelines during friday 's <unk> <eos>
 mr. phelan said it will take another day or two to analyze who was buying and selling friday <eos>

 ports of call inc. reached agreements to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that were n't disclosed <eos>
 the agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes the travel company has sold this year as part of a restructuring <eos>
 the company said a portion of the $ N million realized from the sales will be used to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended <unk> operations <eos>
 earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fleet of boeing co. <unk> because of increasing maintenance costs <eos>
 a consortium of private investors operating as <unk> funding co. said it has made a $ N million cash bid for most of l.j. hooker corp. 's real-estate and <unk> holdings <eos>
 the $ N million bid includes the assumption of an estimated $ N million in secured liabilities on those properties according to those making the bid <eos>
 the group is led by jay <unk> chief executive officer of <unk> investment corp. in <unk> and a. boyd simpson chief executive of the atlanta-based simpson organization inc <eos>
 mr. <unk> 's company specializes in commercial real-estate investment and claims to have $ N billion in assets mr. simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of l.j. hooker <eos>
 the assets are good but they require more money and management than can be provided in l.j. hooker 's current situation said mr. simpson in an interview <eos>
 hooker 's philosophy was to build and sell <eos>
 we want to build and hold <eos>
 l.j. hooker based in atlanta is operating with protection from its creditors under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code <eos>
 its parent company hooker corp. of sydney australia is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional <unk> <eos>
 sanford <unk> chief executive of l.j. hooker said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee <eos>
 the $ N million bid is estimated by mr. simpson as representing N N of the value of all hooker real-estate holdings in the u.s. <eos>
 not included in the bid are <unk> teller or b. altman & co. l.j. hooker 's department-store chains <eos>
 the offer covers the massive N <unk> forest fair mall in cincinnati the N <unk> <unk> fashion mall in columbia s.c. and the N <unk> <unk> town center mall in <unk> <unk> <eos>
 the <unk> mall opened sept. N with a <unk> 's <unk> as its <unk> the columbia mall is expected to open nov. N <eos>
 other hooker properties included are a <unk> office tower in <unk> atlanta expected to be completed next february vacant land sites in florida and ohio l.j. hooker international the commercial real-estate brokerage company that once did business as merrill lynch commercial real estate plus other shopping centers <eos>
 the consortium was put together by <unk> <unk> the london-based investment banking company that is a subsidiary of security pacific corp <eos>
 we do n't anticipate any problems in raising the funding for the bid said <unk> campbell the head of mergers and acquisitions at <unk> <unk> in an interview <eos>
 <unk> <unk> is acting as the consortium 's investment bankers <eos>
 according to people familiar with the consortium the bid was <unk> project <unk> a reference to the film <unk> in which a <unk> played by actress <unk> <unk> is saved from a <unk> businessman by a police officer named john <unk> <eos>
 l.j. hooker was a small <unk> company based in atlanta in N when mr. simpson was hired to push it into commercial development <eos>
 the company grew modestly until N when a majority position in hooker corp. was acquired by australian developer george <unk> currently hooker 's chairman <eos>
 mr. <unk> <unk> to launch an ambitious but <unk> $ N billion acquisition binge that included <unk> teller and b. altman & co. as well as majority positions in merksamer jewelers a sacramento chain <unk> inc. the <unk> retailer and <unk> inc. the southeast department-store chain <eos>
 eventually mr. simpson and mr. <unk> had a falling out over the direction of the company and mr. simpson said he resigned in N <eos>
 since then hooker corp. has sold its interest in the <unk> chain back to <unk> 's management and is currently attempting to sell the b. altman & co. chain <eos>
 in addition robert <unk> chief executive of the <unk> chain is seeking funds to buy out the hooker interest in his company <eos>
 the merksamer chain is currently being offered for sale by first boston corp <eos>
 reached in <unk> mr. <unk> said that he believes the various hooker <unk> can become profitable with new management <eos>
 these are n't mature assets but they have the potential to be so said mr. <unk> <eos>
 managed properly and with a long-term outlook these can become investment-grade quality properties <eos>
 canadian <unk> production totaled N metric tons in the week ended oct. N up N N from the preceding week 's total of N tons statistics canada a federal agency said <eos>

 as small investors <unk> their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend big fund managers said they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals cash <eos>
 unlike the weekend before black monday the funds were n't <unk> with heavy withdrawal requests <eos>
 and many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week <eos>
 at fidelity investments the nation 's largest fund company telephone volume was up sharply but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding black monday in N <eos>
 the boston firm said <unk> redemptions were running at less than one-third the level two years ago <eos>
 as of yesterday afternoon the redemptions represented less than N N of the total cash position of about $ N billion of fidelity 's stock funds <eos>
 two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around said c. bruce <unk> who runs fidelity investments ' $ N billion <unk> fund <eos>
 this feels more like a <unk> deal <eos>
 people are n't <unk> <eos>
 the test may come today <eos>
 friday 's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act <eos>
 some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices <eos>
 stock fund redemptions during the N debacle did n't begin to <unk> until after the market opened on black monday <eos>
 but fund managers say they 're ready <eos>
 many have raised cash levels which act as a buffer against steep market declines <eos>
 mario <unk> for instance holds cash positions well above N N in several of his funds <eos>
 windsor fund 's john <unk> and mutual series ' michael price said they had raised their cash levels to more than N N and N N respectively this year <eos>
 even peter lynch manager of fidelity 's $ N billion <unk> fund the nation 's largest stock fund built up cash to N N or $ N million <eos>
 one reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in august and september <eos>
 i 've let the money build up mr. lynch said who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes <eos>
 not all funds have raised cash levels of course <eos>
 as a group stock funds held N N of assets in cash as of august the latest figures available from the investment company institute <eos>
 that was modestly higher than the N N and N N levels in august and september of N <eos>
 also persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash <eos>
 but a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around fund managers said <eos>
 a major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since black monday <eos>
 <unk> sales have rebounded in recent months but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half N levels <eos>
 there 's not nearly as much <unk> said john <unk> chairman of vanguard group inc. a big valley forge pa. fund company <eos>
 many fund managers argue that now 's the time to buy <eos>
 vincent <unk> manager of the $ N billion wellington fund added to his positions in bristol-myers squibb woolworth and dun & bradstreet friday <eos>
 and today he 'll be looking to buy drug stocks like eli lilly pfizer and american home products whose dividend yields have been bolstered by stock declines <eos>
 fidelity 's mr. lynch for his part snapped up southern co. shares friday after the stock got <unk> <eos>
 if the market drops further today he said he 'll be buying blue chips such as bristol-myers and kellogg <eos>
 if they <unk> stocks like that he said it presents an opportunity that is the kind of thing you dream about <eos>
 major mutual-fund groups said phone calls were <unk> at twice the normal weekend pace yesterday <eos>
 but most investors were seeking share prices and other information <eos>
 trading volume was only modestly higher than normal <eos>
 still fund groups are n't taking any chances <eos>
 they hope to avoid the <unk> phone lines and other <unk> that <unk> some fund investors in october N <eos>
 fidelity on saturday opened its N <unk> investor centers across the country <eos>
 the centers normally are closed through the weekend <eos>
 in addition east coast centers will open at N edt this morning instead of the normal N <eos>
 t. rowe price associates inc. increased its staff of phone representatives to handle investor requests <eos>
 the <unk> group noted that some investors moved money from stock funds to money-market funds <eos>
 but most investors seemed to be in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode said steven <unk> a vice president <eos>
 and vanguard among other groups said it was adding more phone representatives today to help investors get through <eos>
 in an unusual move several funds moved to calm investors with <unk> on their <unk> phone lines <eos>
 we view friday 's market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long-term investors a recording at <unk> & co. funds said over the weekend <eos>
 the <unk> group had a similar recording for investors <eos>
 several fund managers expect a rough market this morning before prices stabilize <eos>
 some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year 's fat profits <eos>
 stock funds have averaged a staggering gain of N N through september according to lipper analytical services inc <eos>
 <unk> <unk> who runs shearson lehman hutton inc. 's $ N million sector analysis portfolio predicts the market will open down at least N points on technical factors and some panic selling <eos>
 but she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market wo n't decline more than N N to N N from recent highs <eos>
 this is not a major crash she said <eos>
 nevertheless ms. <unk> said she was <unk> with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders <eos>
 half of them are really scared and want to sell she said but i 'm trying to talk them out of it <eos>
 she added if they all were bullish i 'd really be upset <eos>
 the backdrop to friday 's slide was <unk> different from that of the october N crash fund managers argue <eos>
 two years ago unlike today the dollar was weak interest rates were rising and the market was very <unk> they say <eos>
 from the investors ' standpoint institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson by selling at the lows on black monday said stephen boesel manager of the $ N million t. rowe price growth and income fund <eos>
 this time i do n't think we 'll get a panic reaction <eos>
 newport corp. said it expects to report <unk> earnings of between N cents and N cents a share somewhat below analysts ' estimates of N cents to N cents <eos>
 the maker of scientific instruments and laser parts said orders fell below expectations in recent months <eos>
 a spokesman added that sales in the current quarter will about equal the <unk> quarter 's figure when newport reported net income of $ N million or N cents a share on $ N million in sales <eos>
 <unk> from the strike by N machinists union members against boeing co. reached air carriers friday as america west airlines announced it will postpone its new service out of houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the seattle jet maker <eos>
 peter <unk> vice president for planning at the phoenix ariz. carrier said in an interview that the work <unk> at boeing now entering its 13th day has caused some turmoil in our scheduling and that more than N passengers who were booked to fly out of houston on america west would now be put on other airlines <eos>
 mr. <unk> said boeing told america west that the N it was supposed to get this thursday would n't be delivered until nov. N the day after the airline had been planning to <unk> service at houston with four daily flights including three <unk> to phoenix and one <unk> to las vegas <eos>
 now those routes are n't expected to begin until jan <eos>
 boeing is also supposed to send to america west another N <unk> aircraft as well as a N by year 's end <eos>
 those too are almost certain to arrive late <eos>
 at this point no other america west flights including its new service at san antonio texas newark n.j. and <unk> calif. have been affected by the delays in boeing deliveries <eos>
 nevertheless the company 's reaction <unk> the <unk> effect that a huge manufacturer such as boeing can have on other parts of the economy <eos>
 it also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company <eos>
 i just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged <unk> tom baker president of machinists ' district N said in an interview yesterday <eos>
 i do n't think their customers would like it very much <eos>
 america west though is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be <eos>
 i figure that american and united probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets they might not miss one at all mr. <unk> said <eos>
 indeed a random check friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations <eos>
 southwest airlines has a boeing N set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time <eos>
 it 's so close to completion boeing 's told us there wo n't be a problem said a southwest spokesman <eos>
 a spokesman for amr corp. said boeing has assured american airlines it will deliver a N on time later this month <eos>
 american is preparing to take delivery of another N in early december and N more next year and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable <eos>
 in seattle a boeing spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike <eos>
 meanwhile supervisors and <unk> employees have been trying to finish some N aircraft mostly N and N jumbo jets at the company 's <unk> wash. plant that were all but completed before the <unk> <eos>
 as of friday four had been delivered and a fifth plane a N was supposed to be <unk> out over the weekend to air china <eos>
 no date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table <eos>
 we want to make sure they know what they want before they come back said doug hammond the federal mediator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began <eos>
 the investment community for one has been anticipating a <unk> resolution <eos>
 though boeing 's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market friday it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders <eos>
 the market has taken two views that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very <unk> for boeing in the long term said howard <unk> an analyst at <unk> j. lawrence inc <eos>
 boeing 's shares fell $ N friday to close at $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange <eos>
 but mr. baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month <unk> that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week <eos>
 still he said it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer <eos>
 i would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything <eos>
 last week boeing chairman frank <unk> sent striking workers a letter saying that to my knowledge boeing 's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major u.s. industrial firm in recent history <eos>
 but mr. baker called the letter and the company 's offer of a N N wage increase over the life of the pact plus bonuses very weak <eos>
 he added that the company <unk> the union 's resolve and the workers ' <unk> with being forced to work many hours overtime <eos>
 in separate developments talks have broken off between machinists representatives at lockheed corp. and the <unk> calif. aerospace company <eos>
 the union is continuing to work through its expired contract however <eos>
 it had planned a strike vote for next sunday but that has been pushed back indefinitely <eos>
 united auto workers local N which represents N workers at boeing 's helicopter unit in delaware county pa. said it agreed to extend its contract on a <unk> basis with a <unk> notification to cancel while it continues bargaining <eos>
 the accord expired yesterday <eos>
 and boeing on friday said it received an order from <unk> <unk> for four model N <unk> <unk> valued at a total of about $ N million <eos>
 the planes long range versions of the <unk> <unk> will be delivered with <unk> & <unk> <unk> engines <eos>
 <unk> & <unk> is a unit of united technologies inc <eos>

 a boeing spokeswoman said a delivery date for the planes is still being worked out for a variety of reasons but not because of the strike <eos>

 <unk> <unk> <unk> 's senior vice president finance said its <unk> canadian utilities ltd. unit is reviewing <unk> projects in eastern canada and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere including britain where the british government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private-sector suppliers as part of its privatization program <eos>
 the projects are big <eos>
 they can be c$ N billion plus mr. <unk> said <eos>
 but we would n't go into them alone and canadian utilities ' equity stake would be small he said <eos>
 <unk> we 'd like to be the operator of the project and a modest equity investor <eos>
 our long suit is our proven ability to operate power plants he said <eos>
 mr. <unk> would n't offer <unk> regarding <unk> 's proposed british project but he said it would compete for customers with two huge british power generating companies that would be formed under the country 's plan to <unk> its massive water and electric utilities <eos>
 britain 's government plans to raise about # N billion $ N billion from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities beginning next month <eos>
 the planned electric utility sale scheduled for next year is alone expected to raise # N billion making it the world 's largest public offering <eos>
 under terms of the plan independent <unk> would be able to compete for N N of customers until N and for another N N between N and N <eos>
 canadian utilities had N revenue of c$ N billion mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in alberta where the company serves about N customers <eos>
 there seems to be a move around the world to <unk> the generation of electricity mr. <unk> said and canadian utilities hopes to capitalize on it <eos>
 this is a real thrust on our utility side he said adding that canadian utilities is also <unk> projects in <unk> countries though he would be specific <eos>
 canadian utilities is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in britain in anticipation of the privatization program <eos>
 we 're certainly looking at some power generating projects in england said bruce <unk> vice president corporate strategy and corporate planning with enron corp. houston a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator <eos>
 mr. <unk> said enron is considering building <unk> power plants in the u.k. capable of producing about N <unk> of power at a cost of about $ N million to $ N million <eos>
 pse inc. said it expects to report third earnings of $ N million to $ N million or N cents to N cents a share <eos>
 in the year-ago quarter the designer and operator of <unk> and waste heat recovery plants had net income of $ N or four cents a share on revenue of about $ N million <eos>

 <unk> & broad home corp. said it formed a $ N million limited partnership subsidiary to buy land in california suitable for residential development <eos>
 the partnership <unk> & broad land development venture limited partnership is a N joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of <unk> advisory corp. a unit of <unk> financial corp. a real estate advisory management and development company with offices in chicago and beverly hills calif <eos>
 <unk> & broad a home building company declined to identify the institutional investors <eos>
 the land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received <unk> and other approvals required for development and part of <unk> & broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals <eos>
 the partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development but in return it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices which can result in sizable savings said bruce <unk> president and chief executive officer of <unk> & broad <eos>
 there are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash <eos>
 typically developers option property and then once they get the administrative approvals they buy it said mr. <unk> adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind <eos>
 we usually operate in that conservative manner <eos>
 by setting up the joint venture <unk> & broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land while avoiding the negative <unk> to its own balance sheet mr. <unk> said <eos>
 the company is putting up only N N of the capital although it is responsible for providing management planning and processing services to the joint venture <eos>
 this is one of the best ways to assure a pipeline of land to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company mr. <unk> said <eos>
 when the price of plastics took off in N quantum chemical corp. went along for the ride <eos>
 the timing of quantum 's chief executive officer john <unk> <unk> appeared to be nothing less than inspired because he had just increased quantum 's reliance on plastics <eos>
 the company <unk> much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew <unk> in two years <eos>
 mr. <unk> said of the boom it 's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks <eos>

 the stock having lost nearly a quarter of its value since sept. N closed at $ N share down $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading friday <eos>
 to a degree quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that <unk> modern life <eos>
 having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history these producers now see their prices eroding <eos>
 pricing cycles to be sure are nothing new for plastics producers <eos>
 and the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the <unk> period that is just behind them <eos>
 we were all wonderful heroes last year says an executive at one of quantum 's competitors <eos>
 now we 're at the bottom of the <unk> <eos>
 at quantum which is based in new york the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy <unk> on plastics <eos>
 once known as national <unk> & chemical corp. the company <unk> the wine and spirits business and <unk> more of its resources into plastics after mr. <unk> took the chief executive 's job in N <eos>
 mr. <unk> N years old declined to be interviewed for this article but he has consistently argued that over the long haul across both the <unk> and the <unk> of the plastics market quantum will <unk> through its new direction <eos>
 quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene <unk> used to make garbage bags milk <unk> <unk> toys and meat packaging among other items <eos>
 in the u.s. polyethylene market quantum has claimed the largest share about N N <eos>
 but its competitors including dow chemical co. union carbide corp. and several oil giants have much broader business interests and so are better <unk> against price swings <eos>
 when the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound quantum 's annual profit <unk> by about N cents a share provided no other <unk> are changing <eos>
 in recent months the price of polyethylene even more than that of other commodity plastics has taken a dive <eos>
 benchmark grades which still sold for as much as N cents a pound last spring have skidded to between N cents and N cents <eos>
 meanwhile the price of <unk> the chemical building block of polyethylene has n't dropped nearly so fast <eos>
 that <unk> <unk> quantum badly because its own plants cover only about half of its <unk> needs <eos>
 by many accounts an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year <eos>
 china which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene abruptly halted them <eos>
 <unk> that excess polyethylene would soon be <unk> around the world other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product <eos>
 kenneth mitchell director of dow 's polyethylene business says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices <unk> up <eos>
 people were even <unk> bags he says <eos>
 now producers hope prices have hit bottom <eos>
 they recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks <eos>
 no one knows however whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to <unk> <eos>
 one <unk> is george <unk> a <unk> analyst at oppenheimer & co. and a bear on plastics stocks <eos>
 noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained he remarks some say october <eos>
 some say november <eos>
 i say N <eos>
 he argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers ' plans to expand production capacity <eos>
 a quick turnaround is crucial to quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy <eos>
 the company is trying to carry out a three-year $ N billion <unk> program started this year <eos>
 at the same time its annual payments on long-term debt will more than double from a year ago to about $ N million largely because of debt taken on to pay a $ <unk> special dividend earlier this year <eos>
 quantum described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the <unk> with its holders because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases <eos>
 some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to <unk> takeover speculation <eos>
 whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend raised N N to N cents a share only a year ago has become a topic of intense speculation on wall street since mr. <unk> <unk> dividend questions in a sept. N meeting with analysts <eos>
 some viewed his response that company directors review the dividend regularly as nothing more than the standard line from executives <eos>
 but others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual <unk> performance <eos>
 in any case on the day of the meeting quantum 's shares slid $ N to $ N in big board trading <eos>
 on top of everything else quantum <unk> a disaster at its plant in morris ill <eos>
 after an explosion <unk> the plant in june the company <unk> in september to within N hours of completing the <unk> process of <unk> it <eos>
 then a second explosion occurred <eos>
 two workers died and six remain in the hospital <eos>
 this human toll adds the most painful <unk> yet to the sudden change in quantum 's fortunes <eos>
 until this year the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up <unk> safety <unk> <eos>
 a prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another <unk> into quantum 's financial future <eos>
 when a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand <unk> lost profit and thus claims under <unk> insurance is <unk> <eos>
 but the numbers become <unk> and subject to <unk> between insured and insurer when demand is shifting <eos>
 you say you could have sold x percent of this product and <unk> percent of that recalls <unk> <unk> an analyst at shearson lehman hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer <eos>
 and then you still have to negotiate <eos>
 quantum hopes the morris plant where limited production got under way last week will resume full operation by year 's end <eos>
 the plant usually accounts for N N to N N of quantum 's polyethylene production and N N of its <unk> production <eos>
 not everything looks grim for quantum <eos>
 the plant expansion should strengthen the company 's <unk> in the polyethylene business where market share is often taken through sheer capacity <eos>
 by lifting <unk> production the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs <eos>
 quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals propane marketing <eos>
 through a venture with its investment banker first boston corp. quantum completed in august an acquisition of <unk> inc. in a transaction valued at $ N billion <eos>
 <unk> is the second-largest propane distributor in the u.s. <eos>
 the largest suburban propane was already owned by quantum <eos>
 still quantum has a crisis to get past right now <eos>
 some analysts speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor <eos>
 the name <unk> in rumors is british petroleum co. which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the u.s. <eos>
 asked about a bid for quantum a <unk> spokesman says we pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors and i think that falls in that category <eos>
 rjr nabisco inc. is <unk> its division responsible for buying network advertising time just a month after moving N of the group 's N employees to new york from atlanta <eos>
 a spokesman for the new york-based food and tobacco giant taken private earlier this year in a $ N billion leveraged buy-out by kohlberg kravis roberts & co. confirmed that it is <unk> down the rjr nabisco broadcast unit and <unk> its N employees in a move to save money <eos>
 the spokesman said rjr is discussing its <unk> plans with its two main advertising firms <unk> katz and <unk> <unk> <eos>
 we found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost said the spokesman who declined to specify how much rjr spends on network television time <eos>
 an executive close to the company said rjr is spending about $ N million on network television time this year down from roughly $ N million last year <eos>
 the spokesman said the broadcast unit will be <unk> dec. N and the move wo n't affect rjr 's print radio and <unk> buying practices <eos>
 the broadcast group had been based in new york until a year ago when rjr 's previous management moved it to atlanta the company 's headquarters before this summer <eos>
 one employee with the group said rjr moved N employees of the group back to new york in september because there was supposed to be a future <eos>
 he said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies <eos>
 the rjr spokesman said the company moved the N employees to new york last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' <unk> season <eos>
 the studies on closing the unit could n't be completed until now he said <eos>
 the group 's president peter <unk> was n't in his office friday afternoon to comment <eos>
 the u.s. which is <unk> its <unk> quotas is <unk> a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively <unk> steel industries <eos>
 meanwhile the u.s. has negotiated a significant cut in japan 's steel quota and made only a minor increase to the steel <unk> for the european community <eos>
 brazil similar to mexico and south korea is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the u.s. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas which expired sept. N <eos>
 brazil and venezuela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the u.s. for the year ending oct. N N <eos>
 in recent years u.s. steelmakers have supplied about N N of the N million tons of steel used annually by the nation <eos>
 of the remaining N N needed the <unk> negotiations <unk> about N N to foreign suppliers with the difference supplied mainly by canada which is n't included in the quota program <eos>
 other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the u.s. such as taiwan sweden and argentina also have supplied steel <eos>
 some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the u.s. that are similar to quotas <eos>
 the bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas known as voluntary restraint agreements until march N N <eos>
 it also said it would use that <unk> year period to work toward an international consensus on <unk> up the international steel trade which has been <unk> managed subsidized and protected by governments <eos>
 the u.s. termed its plan a trade <unk> program despite the fact that it is merely an extension <eos>
 mexico which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the u.s. virtually doubled its quota to N N of the u.s. steel market from N N under the previous quotas <eos>
 south korea which had N N under the previous quotas is set to get a small increase to about N N <eos>
 that increase rises to slightly more than N N of the u.s. market if a joint <unk> steel project is included <eos>
 meanwhile brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the N N share it has had in recent years <eos>
 the ec and japan the u.s. 's largest steel suppliers have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent <eos>
 the ec steel industry which has been coping with strong european demand has been supplying about N N of the u.s. market compared with recent quotas of about N N <eos>
 japan has been shipping steel to total about N N of the u.s. market compared with a quota of N N <eos>
 in the recent talks the ec had its quota increased about N tons to N N of the u.s. market from N N in N <eos>
 but its quota has been as high as N N in N <eos>
 japan however has agreed to cut its quota to about N N from N N previously <eos>
 japan the ec brazil mexico and south korea provide about N N of the steel imported to the u.s. under the quota program <eos>
 the balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters such as australia and venezuela <eos>
 the u.s. had about an extra N N of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks <eos>
 that was essentially made up of a N N increase in the overall quota program and N N from cutting japan 's allowance <eos>
 negotiators from the white house trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another N N of the u.s. steel market to <unk> <eos>
 these <unk> <unk> increases to the steel quota program are built into the bush administration 's <unk> program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and <unk> from their own steel industries <eos>
 <unk> inc. expects fiscal second-quarter earnings to trail N results but anticipates that several new products will lead to a much stronger performance in its second half <eos>
 <unk> a telecommunications company had net income of $ N or five cents a share in its year-earlier second quarter ended sept. N <eos>
 revenue totaled $ N million <eos>
 george <unk> chairman and chief executive officer said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ N million <eos>
 the lower results mr. <unk> said reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones <unk> 's primary business <eos>
 although mr. <unk> expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year he said <unk> will also benefit from moving into other areas <eos>
 <unk> among those is the company 's <unk> into the public facsimile business mr. <unk> said <eos>
 within the next year <unk> expects to place N fax machines made by <unk> in japan in hotels municipal buildings <unk> and other public <unk> around the country <eos>
 <unk> will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to collect store and forward billing data <eos>
 mr. <unk> said <unk> should realize a minimum of $ N of <unk> net earnings for each machine each month <eos>
 <unk> has also developed an automatic call <unk> that will make further use of the company 's system for <unk> and handling credit-card calls and collect calls <eos>
 automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone mr. <unk> said not just phones produced by <unk> <eos>
 the company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones which do n't accept coins for use in hotel <unk> office <unk> <unk> <unk> and similar <unk> <eos>
 mr. <unk> estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce about $ N of <unk> net earnings for each machine each month <eos>
 britain 's retail price index rose N N in september from august and was up N N for the year the central statistical office said <eos>
 <unk> medical inc. said it adopted a shareholders ' rights plan in which rights to purchase shares of common stock will be distributed as a dividend to shareholders of record as of oct. N <eos>
 the company said the plan was n't adopted in response to any known offers for <unk> a maker and marketer of hospital products <eos>
 the rights allow shareholders to purchase <unk> stock at a discount if any person or group acquires more than N N of the company 's common stock or <unk> a tender offer <eos>
 measuring <unk> may soon be replaced by <unk> in the <unk> room <eos>
 procter & gamble co. plans to begin testing next month a <unk> detergent that will require only a few <unk> per <unk> <eos>
 the move stems from <unk> learned in japan where local competitors have had <unk> success with concentrated <unk> <eos>
 it also marks p&g 's growing concern that its japanese rivals such as <unk> corp. may bring their <unk> to the u.s. <eos>
 the cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in japan when <unk> introduced a powerful detergent called attack which quickly won a N N stake in the japanese markets <eos>
 they do n't want to get caught again says one industry <unk> <eos>
 retailers in phoenix ariz. say p&g 's new <unk> detergent to be called <unk> with color guard will be on shelves in that market by early november <eos>
 a p&g spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to phoenix started late last month <eos>
 she said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others <eos>
 <unk> are n't entirely new for p&g <eos>
 the company introduced a <unk> <unk> <unk> in japan after watching the success of attack <eos>
 when attack hit the shelves in N p&g 's share of the japanese market fell to about N N from more than N N <eos>
 with the help of <unk> <unk> p&g 's share is now estimated to be N N <eos>
 while the japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products the true test for p&g will be in the $ N billion u.s. detergent market where growth is slow and <unk> have gained <unk> over <unk> <eos>
 the company may have chosen to market the product under the <unk> name since it 's already expanded its <unk> tide into N different <unk> including this year 's big hit tide with <unk> <eos>
 with <unk> however it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more many people tend to dump too much detergent into the <unk> machine <unk> that it takes a cup of <unk> to really clean the <unk> <eos>
 in the early 1980s p&g tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the <unk> brand name that it markets in europe <eos>
 but the product which was n't as concentrated as the new <unk> <unk> in a market test in denver and was dropped <eos>
 p&g and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric <unk> <unk> in <unk> but they have n't sold well despite the convenience <eos>
 but p&g contends the new <unk> is a unique formula that also offers an <unk> that prevents colors from <unk> <eos>
 and retailers are expected to <unk> the product in part because it will take up less shelf space <eos>
 when shelf space was cheap bigger was better says <unk> <unk> an analyst at salomon <unk> <eos>
 but with so many brands <unk> for space that 's no longer the case <eos>
 if the new <unk> sells well the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own <unk> <eos>
 then retailers will probably push the <unk> brands out altogether he says <eos>
 competition is bound to get tougher if <unk> <unk> a product like attack in the u.s. <eos>
 to be sure <unk> would n't have an easy time taking u.s. market share away from the mighty p&g which has about N N of the market <eos>
 <unk> officials previously have said they are interested in selling <unk> in the u.s. but so far the company has focused on acquisitions such as last year 's purchase of andrew <unk> co. a cincinnati <unk> maker <eos>
 it also has a <unk> facility in california <eos>
 some believe p&g 's interest in a <unk> detergent goes beyond the concern for the japanese <eos>
 this is something p&g would do with or without <unk> says mr. <unk> <eos>
 with economic tension between the u.s. and japan worsening many japanese had feared last week 's visit from u.s. trade representative carla hills <eos>
 they expected a new <unk> of demands that japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the u.s. <eos>
 instead they got a discussion of the need for the u.s. and japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view <eos>
 mrs. hills ' first trip to japan as america 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by commerce secretary robert a. mosbacher <eos>
 mr. mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade <eos>
 he said such results should be <unk> in dollars and cents in reducing the u.s. trade deficit with japan <eos>
 but mrs. hills speaking at a breakfast meeting of the american chamber of commerce in japan on saturday stressed that the objective is not to get definitive action by spring or summer it is rather to have a blueprint for action <eos>
 she added that she expected perhaps to have a down payment some small step to convince the american people and the japanese people that we 're moving in <unk> <eos>
 how such remarks translate into policy wo n't become clear for months <eos>
 american and japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach <unk> mr. mosbacher and mrs. hills <eos>
 many called it simply a contrast in styles <eos>
 but some saw it as a classic negotiating <unk> <eos>
 others said the bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand <eos>
 and some said it reflected the growing debate in washington over pursuing free trade with japan <unk> some kind of managed trade <eos>
 asked to compare her visit to mr. mosbacher 's mrs. hills replied i did n't hear every word he spoke but as a general proposition i think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the bush administration <eos>
 yet more than one american official who sat in with her during three days of talks with japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly <unk> <eos>
 i think my line has been very consistent mrs. hills said at a news conference saturday afternoon <eos>
 i am painted sometimes as <unk> perhaps because i have a <unk> list of statutes to implement <eos>
 i do n't feel very <unk> <eos>
 i do n't feel either hard or soft <eos>
 i feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade <eos>
 when she met the local press for the first time on friday mrs. hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products <unk> and <unk> three areas targeted under the <unk> N provision of the N trade bill <eos>
 she <unk> <unk> business practices that the u.s. government has identified <eos>
 but her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition <eos>
 she said the trade <unk> was mainly due to <unk> factors and should n't be <unk> by setting <unk> targets <eos>
 at her news conference for japanese reporters one economics journalist <unk> up the japanese sense of relief <eos>
 my impression was that you would be a scary old lady he said drawing a few nervous <unk> from his colleagues <eos>
 but i am relieved to see that you are beautiful and <unk> and <unk> and a person of integrity <eos>
 mrs. hills ' remarks did raise questions at least among some u.s. officials about what exactly her stance is on u.s. access to the japanese semiconductor market <eos>
 the u.s. share of the japanese market has been stuck around N N for years <eos>
 many americans have interpreted a N agreement as <unk> u.s. companies a N N share by N but the japanese have denied making any such promise <eos>
 at one of her news conferences mrs. hills said i believe we can do much better than N N <eos>
 but she stressed i am against managed trade <eos>
 i will not enter into an agreement that <unk> to a percentage of the market <eos>
 traditional industries inc. said it expects to report a net loss for the fourth quarter that ended june N and is seeking new financing <eos>
 the seller of photographic products and services said it is considering a number of financing alternatives including seeking increases in its credit lines <eos>
 traditional declined to estimate the amount of the loss and would n't say if it expects to show a profit for the year <eos>
 in the year ended june N N traditional reported net income of $ N million or $ N a share <eos>
 the company did n't break out its fourth-quarter results <eos>
 in the latest nine months net income was $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million <eos>
 separately the company said it would file a delayed <unk> report with the securities and exchange commission within approximately N days <eos>
 it said the delay resulted from difficulties in <unk> its accounting of a settlement with the federal trade commission <eos>
 under an agreement filed in federal court in august to settle ftc objections to some traditional sales practices traditional said it would establish a $ N trust fund to provide refunds to certain customers <eos>
 information international inc. said it was sued by a buyer of its computerized <unk> system alleging that the company failed to correct deficiencies in the system <eos>
 a spokesman for information international said the lawsuit by two units of morris communications corp. seeks <unk> of the system 's about $ N million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the morris units to information international for alleged failure to pay royalties <eos>
 information international said it believes that the complaints filed in federal court in georgia are without merit <eos>
 closely held morris communications is based in <unk> <unk> <eos>
 the units that filed the suit are <unk> newspapers corp. and florida publishing co <eos>
 <unk> corp. completed the sale of its a. <unk> & co. subsidiary a men 's luxury <unk> to <unk> investments <eos>
 terms were n't disclosed <eos>
 as <unk> 's core business of <unk> retailing grows a small subsidiary that is <unk> unrelated becomes a difficult <unk> said <unk> <unk> president of the parent in a statement <eos>
 a spokeswoman said <unk> operates a total of seven stores in the u.s. and overseas <eos>
 <unk> operates N <unk> apparel stores in the u.s. <eos>
 the oil industry 's <unk> profits could <unk> through the rest of the year <eos>
 major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability <eos>
 the gasoline picture may improve this quarter but chemicals are likely to remain weak industry executives and analysts say reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance <eos>
 the industry is seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals glenn cox president of phillips petroleum co. said in an interview <eos>
 that change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings for the industry in general he added <eos>
 he did n't forecast phillips 's results <eos>
 but securities analysts say phillips will be among the companies <unk> by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings <eos>
 so too many analysts predict will exxon corp. chevron corp. and amoco corp <eos>
 typical is what happened to the price of <unk> a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies <eos>
 it has plunged N N since july to around N cents a pound <eos>
 a year ago <unk> sold for N cents <unk> at about N cents last december <eos>
 a big reason for the chemical price retreat is <unk> <eos>
 beginning in <unk> prices began accelerating as a growing u.s. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand <eos>
 companies added capacity <unk> <eos>
 now greatly increased supplies are on the market while the dollar is stronger and domestic economic growth is slower <eos>
 third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker <eos>
 refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year said william <unk> a securities analyst at first boston corp <eos>
 oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in july and august that did n't <unk> <eos>
 the excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period <eos>
 in addition crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier further <unk> profitability <eos>
 refiners say margins picked up in september and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter though still not to the level of N 's fourth quarter <eos>
 during the N second half many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits <eos>
 crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year <eos>
 prices averaging roughly $ N a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier have stayed well above most companies ' expectations <eos>
 demand has been much stronger than anticipated and it typically <unk> in the fourth quarter <eos>
 we could see higher oil prices this year said <unk> <unk> an analyst at painewebber inc <eos>
 that will translate into sharply higher production profits particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ N a barrel in the fourth quarter <eos>
 while oil prices have been better than expected natural gas prices have been worse <eos>
 in the third quarter they averaged about N N less than they were in N <eos>
 the main reason remains weather <eos>
 last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to <unk> more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air <unk> use <eos>
 this summer on the other hand had <unk> weather than usual <eos>
 we 've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices said mr. cox phillips 's president <eos>
 the lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected <eos>
 going into the fourth quarter natural gas prices are anywhere from N N to N N lower than a year earlier <eos>
 for instance natural gas currently produced along the gulf coast is selling on the spot market for around $ N a thousand cubic feet down N N from $ N a thousand cubic feet a year ago <eos>
 the bush administration trying to blunt growing demands from western europe for a <unk> of controls on exports to the soviet bloc is questioning whether italy 's <unk> c. olivetti & co. supplied <unk> valuable technology to the soviets <eos>
 most of the western european members of <unk> committee on <unk> export controls the <unk> forum through which the u.s. and its allies <unk> their <unk> policies are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in paris oct. N and N <eos>
 they plan to press specifically for a <unk> of rules governing exports of machine tools computers and other high-technology products <eos>
 but the bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all cocom members are <unk> fully with existing <unk> procedures before it will support further <unk> <eos>
 to make its point it is challenging the italian government to explain reports that olivetti may have supplied the soviet union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft <eos>
 the london sunday times which first reported the u.s. concerns cited a u.s. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that olivetti exported $ N million in <unk> <unk> flexible manufacturing systems to the soviet aviation industry <eos>
 olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in N <eos>
 a state department spokesman acknowledged that the u.s. is discussing the allegations with the italian government and cocom but declined to confirm any details <eos>
 italian president <unk> <unk> promised a quick investigation into whether olivetti broke cocom rules <eos>
 president bush called his attention to the matter during the italian leader 's visit here last week <eos>
 olivetti has denied that it violated cocom rules <unk> that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the italian authorities <eos>
 although the <unk> of these sales is still an open question the disclosure could n't be better <unk> to support the position of <unk> <unk> in the pentagon and the intelligence community <eos>
 it seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important cocom meeting said a washington lobbyist for a number of u.s. computer companies <eos>
 the bush administration has sent <unk> signals about its <unk> policies reflecting <unk> divisions among several competing agencies <eos>
 last summer mr. bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual <unk> when he told a north atlantic treaty organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the cocom <unk> of strategic goods <eos>
 but more recently the pentagon and the commerce department openly <unk> over the extent to which cocom should <unk> exports of personal computers to the bloc <eos>
 however these agencies generally agree that the west should be cautious about any further <unk> <eos>
 there 's no evidence that the soviet program to illegally acquire western technology has diminished said a state department spokesman <eos>
 salomon brothers international ltd. a british subsidiary of salomon inc. announced it will issue warrants on shares of hong kong telecommunications ltd <eos>
 the move closely follows a similar offer by salomon of warrants for shares of <unk> & shanghai banking corp <eos>
 under the latest offer hk$ N million us$ N million of three-year warrants will be issued in london each giving buyers the right to buy one hong kong telecommunications share at a price to be determined friday <eos>
 the N million warrants will be priced at hk$ N each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about N N <eos>
 in trading on the stock exchange of hong kong the shares closed wednesday at hk$ N each <eos>
 at this price the shares would have to rise above hk$ N for subscribers to salomon 's issue to profitably convert their warrants <eos>
 while hong kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares salomon 's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party <eos>
 salomon will cover the warrants by buying sufficient shares or options to purchase shares to cover its entire position <eos>
 bankers said warrants for hong kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors wary of volatility in the colony 's stock market an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk <eos>
 the hong kong telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in europe the bankers added because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the hong kong market that has international appeal <eos>

 ideal basic industries inc. said its directors reached an agreement in principle calling for <unk> north america inc. to combine its north american cement holdings with ideal in a transaction that will leave ideal 's minority shareholders with N N of the combined company <eos>
 <unk> the north american holding company of swiss concern <unk> financiere <unk> ltd. previously proposed combining its N N stake in st. lawrence cement inc. and its N N stake in <unk> cement co. with its N N stake in ideal <eos>

 in response to <unk> domestic supplies agriculture secretary <unk> <unk> last month said the u.s. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments <eos>
 the government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about N million <unk> <eos>
 it now estimates production for next year at just under N billion <unk> compared with this year 's estimated N billion and a <unk> N billion in N <eos>
 but the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year <eos>
 until then limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ <unk> level analysts say <eos>
 on the chicago board of trade friday wheat for december delivery settled at $ N a bushel unchanged <eos>
 in theory at least tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a <unk> squeeze said daniel <unk> a futures analyst with <unk> co. in chicago <eos>
 such a situation can <unk> havoc as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the chicago board of trade <eos>
 in july the <unk> ordered <unk> <unk> s.p a. to liquidate futures positions equal to about N million <unk> of soybeans <eos>
 the exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their <unk> obligation to the italian conglomerate which had refused requests to reduce its holdings <eos>
 <unk> has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market <eos>
 <unk> hot dry weather across large portions of the great plains and in <unk> areas in washington and oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop said <unk> leslie a futures analyst and head of leslie analytical in chicago <eos>

 that figure <unk> to about N N in <unk> portions of kansas he said <eos>
 the soviet union has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans but many analysts expect moscow to place sizable orders for u.s. wheat in the next few months further supporting prices <eos>
 wheat prices will increasingly <unk> off of soviet demand in coming weeks predicted richard <unk> vice president research for <unk> inc. in chicago <eos>

 orange <unk> traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began friday will go <eos>
 late thursday after the close of trading the market received what would normally have been a bullish u.s. department of agriculture estimate of the N florida orange crop <eos>
 it was near the low range of estimates at N million <unk> boxes compared with N million boxes last season <eos>
 however as expected brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its <unk> concentrate to about $ N a pound from around $ N <eos>
 friday 's <unk> selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the u.s. report might have had and sent the november orange <unk> contract down as much as N cents a pound at one time <eos>
 it settled with a loss of N cents at $ N a pound <eos>
 brazilian <unk> after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season is beginning to arrive in the u.s. in large quantities <eos>
 brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product which is going to be in <unk> supply <eos>
 the price cut one analyst said appeared to be aimed even more at europe where consumption of brazilian <unk> has fallen <eos>
 it 's a <unk> product and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in europe the analyst said <eos>
 new york futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ N a pound at midyear <eos>
 barring a cold <unk> or other crop problems in the growing areas downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into january when <unk> and processing of <unk> in florida reach their peak the analyst said <eos>
 energy <eos>
 although some analysts look for profit-taking in the wake of friday 's leap in crude oil prices last week 's rally is generally expected to continue this week <eos>
 i would continue to look for a stable crude market at least in futures trading said william <unk> an energy futures broker with <unk> & co <eos>
 friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets <eos>
 on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate crude for november delivery finished at $ N a barrel up N cents on the day <eos>
 on european markets meanwhile spot prices of north sea <unk> were up N to N cents a barrel <eos>
 this market still wants to go higher said <unk> <unk> a first vice president at shearson lehman hutton inc <eos>
 he predicted that the november contract will reach $ N a barrel or more on the new york mercantile exchange <eos>
 there has been little news to account for such <unk> in the oil markets <eos>
 analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and <unk> <eos>
 there also are <unk> reports that the soviet union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that <unk> has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell <eos>
 many traders <unk> a tightening of near-term supplies particularly of high-quality <unk> such as those produced in the north sea and in <unk> <eos>
 if a hostile <unk> emerges for saatchi & saatchi co. <unk> charles and maurice saatchi will lead a management buy-out attempt an official close to the company said <eos>
 financing for any takeover attempt may be <unk> in the wake of friday 's stock-market sell-off in new york and turmoil in the junk-bond market <eos>
 but the beleaguered british advertising and consulting giant which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace maurice saatchi has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks <eos>
 last week saatchi 's largest shareholder <unk> asset management said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring <eos>
 and carl spielvogel chief executive officer of saatchi 's big backer spielvogel bates advertising unit said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company but was rebuffed by charles saatchi <eos>
 mr. spielvogel said he would n't launch a hostile bid <eos>
 the executive close to saatchi & saatchi said that if a bidder came up with a <unk> high offer a crazy offer which saatchi knew it could n't beat it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders <eos>
 but otherwise it would undoubtedly come back with an offer by management <eos>
 the executive said any buy-out would be led by the current board whose chairman is maurice saatchi and whose strategic <unk> force is believed to be charles saatchi <eos>
 mr. spielvogel is n't part of the board nor are any of the other heads of saatchi 's big <unk> ad agencies <eos>
 the executive did n't name any price but securities analysts have said saatchi would fetch upward of $ N billion <eos>
 the executive denied speculation that saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy-back <eos>
 that speculation <unk> friday as industry executives <unk> the appointment of the new chief executive robert <unk> who joins saatchi and becomes a member of its board on jan. N <eos>
 mr. <unk> formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm <unk> international inc. has a reputation as a <unk> financial manager and will be charged largely with <unk> saatchi 's poor financial state <eos>
 asked about the speculation that mr. <unk> has been hired to <unk> the way for a buy-out by the brothers the executive replied that is n't the reason dreyfus has been brought in <eos>
 he was brought in to turn around the company <eos>
 separately several saatchi agency clients said they believe the company 's management <unk> will have little affect on them <eos>
 it has n't had any impact on us nor do we expect it to said a spokeswoman for miller brewing co. a major client of backer spielvogel <eos>
 john <unk> director of advertising at painewebber inc. a saatchi & saatchi advertising client said we have no problem with the announcement because we do n't know what change it 's going to bring about <eos>
 we are n't going to change agencies because of a change in london <eos>
 executives at backer spielvogel client <unk> inc. as well as at saatchi client <unk> lighting co. also said they saw no effect <eos>
 executives at prudential-bache securities inc. a backer spielvogel client that is reviewing its account declined comment <eos>
 mr. spielvogel had said that prudential-bache was prepared to finance either a management buy-out and restructuring or a buy-out of backer spielvogel alone led by him <eos>

 <unk> products inc. said a u.s. district court in boston ruled that a challenge by <unk> to the <unk> of a u.s. patent held by <unk> inc. was without merit <eos>
 <unk> based in <unk> sweden had charged in a lawsuit against <unk> that <unk> 's <unk> product line <unk> on the <unk> patent <eos>
 the patent is related to <unk> acid a <unk> extract used in eye surgery <eos>
 in its lawsuit <unk> is seeking unspecified damages and a preliminary injunction to block <unk> from selling the <unk> products <eos>
 a <unk> spokesman said the products contribute about a third of <unk> 's sales and N N to N N of its earnings <eos>
 in the year ended aug. N N <unk> earned $ N million or N cents a share on sales of $ N million <eos>
 <unk> said the court 's ruling was issued as part of a <unk> trial in the <unk> proceedings and concerns only one of its defenses in the case <eos>
 it said it is considering all of its options in light of the decision including a possible appeal <eos>
 the <unk> company added that it plans to <unk> its other defenses against <unk> 's lawsuit including the claim that it has n't infringed on <unk> 's patent <eos>
 <unk> said that the court scheduled a conference for next monday to set a date for proceedings on <unk> 's motion for a preliminary injunction <eos>
 newspaper publishers are reporting mixed third-quarter results aided by favorable newsprint prices and hampered by flat or declining advertising <unk> especially in the northeast <eos>
 adding to <unk> in the industry seasonal retail ad spending patterns in newspapers have been upset by shifts in ownership and general <unk> within the retail industry <eos>
 in new york the <unk> teller and b. altman & co. department stores have filed for protection from creditors under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code while the r.h. macy & co. bloomingdale 's and saks fifth avenue department-store chains are for sale <eos>
 many papers throughout the country are also faced with a slowdown in <unk> spending a booming category for newspapers in recent years <eos>
 until recently industry analysts believed <unk> in retail ad spending had <unk> out and would in fact increase in this year 's third and fourth quarters <eos>
 all bets are off analysts say because of the shifting ownership of the retail chains <eos>
 improved paper prices will help offset weakness in <unk> but the retailers ' problems have affected the amount of ad <unk> they usually run said edward j. <unk> industry analyst for salomon brothers inc <eos>
 retailers are just in disarray <eos>
 for instance <unk> co. posted an N N gain in net income as total ad pages dropped at usa today but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates <eos>
 <unk> 's N daily and N <unk> newspapers reported a N N increase in advertising and circulation revenue <eos>
 total advertising <unk> was modestly lower as <unk> volume increased while there was softer demand for retail and national ad <unk> said john <unk> <unk> 's chief executive officer <eos>
 at usa today ad pages totaled N for the quarter down N N from the N period which was helped by increased ad spending from the summer olympics <eos>
 while usa today 's total paid ad pages for the year to date totaled N a decrease of N N from last year the paper 's ad revenue increased N N in the quarter and N N in the nine months <eos>
 in the nine months <unk> 's net rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share <eos>
 revenue gained N N to $ N billion from $ N billion <eos>
 at dow jones & co. third-quarter net income fell N N from the year-earlier period <eos>
 net fell to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share <eos>
 the year-earlier period included a one-time gain of $ N million or four cents a share <eos>
 revenue gained N N to $ N million from $ N million <eos>
 the drop in profit reflected in part continued softness in financial advertising at the wall street journal and barron 's magazine <eos>
 ad <unk> at the journal fell N N in the third quarter <eos>
 affiliated publications inc. reversed a year-earlier third quarter net loss <eos>
 the publisher of the boston globe reported net of $ N million or N cents a share compared with a loss of $ N million or N cents a share for the third quarter in N <eos>
 william o. taylor the parent 's chairman and chief executive officer said earnings continued to be hurt by softness in ad volume at the boston newspaper <eos>
 third-quarter profit estimates for several companies are being strongly affected by the price of newsprint which in the last two years has had several price increases <eos>
 after a supply crunch caused prices to rise N N since N to $ N a metric ton analysts are encouraged because they do n't expect a price increase for the rest of this year <eos>
 companies with daily newspapers in the northeast will need the stable newsprint prices to ease damage from weak ad <unk> <eos>
 mr. <unk> at salomon brothers said he estimates that times mirror co. 's earnings were down for the third quarter because of soft advertising levels at its long island <unk> and hartford <unk> newspapers <eos>
 trouble on the east coast was likely offset by improved ad <unk> at the los angeles times which this week also unveiled a <unk> <eos>
 new york times co. is expected to report lower earnings for the third quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship new york times and deep discounting of newsprint at its affiliate forest products group <eos>
 times co. 's regional daily newspapers are holding up well but there is little sign that things will improve in the new york market said alan <unk> an analyst with shearson lehman hutton <eos>
 washington post co. is expected to report improved earnings largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the washington area <eos>
 according to analysts profits were also helped by successful cost-cutting measures at newsweek <eos>
 the <unk> has faced heightened competition from rival time magazine and a relatively flat magazine advertising market <eos>
 knight-ridder inc. is faced with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its detroit free press and <unk> 's detroit news and has told analysts that earnings were down in the third quarter <eos>
 however analysts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily newspapers such as the miami herald and san jose mercury news <eos>
 the miami market is coming back strong after a tough couple of years when knight-ridder was starting up a hispanic edition and circulation was falling said bruce <unk> an analyst for <unk> national bank <eos>
 general motors corp. in a series of moves that angered union officials in the u.s. and canada has signaled that as many as five north american assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess <unk> capacity <eos>
 in announcements to workers late last week gm effectively signed death <unk> for two <unk> van assembly plants and cast serious doubt on the futures of three u.s. car factories <eos>
 gm is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker 's u.s. market share skidded during the past decade <eos>
 the company currently using about N N of its north american vehicle capacity has vowed it will run at N N of capacity by N <eos>
 just a month ago gm announced it would make an aging assembly plant in <unk> ga. the eighth u.s. assembly facility to close since N <eos>
 now gm appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s <eos>
 one reason is mounting competition from new japanese car plants in the u.s. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than gm can match <eos>
 another is that united auto workers union officials have signaled they want tighter <unk> provisions in the new big three national contract that will be negotiated next year <eos>
 gm officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin <eos>
 the problem however is that gm 's moves are coming at a time when <unk> leaders are trying to <unk> <unk> who charge the union is too passive in the face of gm layoffs <eos>
 against that backdrop <unk> vice president stephen p. <unk> who recently became head of the union 's gm department issued a statement friday <unk> gm 's <unk> <unk> toward union members <eos>
 the auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest <unk> and product <unk> <unk> out in separate <unk> to the affected plants showed disarray and an inability or <unk> to provide consistent information mr. <unk> said <eos>
 gm officials told workers late last week of the following moves production of <unk> vans will be consolidated into a single plant in <unk> mich <eos>
 that means two plants one in <unk> ontario and the other in <unk> ohio probably will be shut down after the end of N <eos>
 the <unk> will idle about N canadian assembly workers and about N workers in ohio <eos>
 robert white canadian auto workers union president used the impending <unk> shutdown to <unk> the <unk> free trade agreement and its champion prime minister brian <unk> <eos>
 but canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate gm move that affects three u.s. car plants and one in quebec <eos>
 workers at plants in van <unk> calif. oklahoma city and <unk> mich. were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the <unk> <unk> and chevrolet <unk> muscle cars <eos>
 gm is studying whether it can build the new <unk> profitably at a plant in st. <unk> quebec company and union officials said <eos>
 that announcement left union officials in van <unk> and oklahoma city uncertain about their futures <eos>
 the van <unk> plant which employs about N workers does n't have a product to build after N <eos>
 jerry <unk> <unk> local president said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a <unk> plant which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand <eos>
 at the oklahoma city plant which employs about N workers building the <unk> <unk> <unk> cars steve <unk> <unk> local vice president said the plant has no new product lined up and none of us knows when the <unk> cars will die <eos>
 he said he believes gm has plans to keep building <unk> cars into the mid-1990s <eos>
 at <unk> however the <unk> decision appears to <unk> <unk> hopes that gm would reopen the <unk> assembly plant that last built the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> model <eos>
 the <unk> plant was viewed as a model of <unk> cooperation at gm before slow sales of the <unk> forced the company to close the factory last year <eos>
 union officials have taken a beating politically as a result <eos>
 dissident <unk> members have used the <unk> plant as a symbol of labor-management cooperation 's failure <eos>
 <unk> merieux s.a. of france said the canadian government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of connaught <unk> inc. for N million canadian dollars us$ N million <eos>
 merieux said the government 's minister of industry science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of net benefit to canada <eos>
 canadian investment rules require that big foreign takeovers meet that standard <eos>
 the french company said the government gave it N days in which to submit information to further support its takeover plan <eos>
 both merieux and connaught are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns <eos>
 the government 's action was unusual <eos>
 alan <unk> executive vice president of investment canada which oversees foreign takeovers said it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse <unk> decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company <eos>
 he said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed <eos>
 this is n't a change in government policy this provision has been used before said <unk> redmond press secretary for <unk> <unk> canada 's minister of industry science and technology <eos>
 mr. <unk> issued the ruling based on a recommendation by investment canada <eos>
 spokesmen for merieux and connaught said they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or investment canada but added they hope to have more information early this week <eos>
 investment canada declined to comment on the reasons for the government decision <eos>
 <unk> mehta a partner with mehta & <unk> a new york-based pharmaceutical industry research firm said the government 's ruling was n't unexpected <eos>
 this has become a very <unk> deal concerning canada 's only large <unk> <unk> or pharmaceutical company mr. mehta said <eos>
 mr. mehta said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an <unk> settlement of connaught 's dispute with the university of toronto <eos>
 the university is seeking to block the acquisition of connaught by foreign interests citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in canada <eos>
 the university is considering a settlement proposal made by connaught <eos>
 while neither side will disclose its <unk> mr. mehta expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in canada than merieux offered to investment canada <eos>
 some analysts such as murray <unk> of toronto-based <unk> <unk> inc. believe the government ruling leaves the door open for other bidders such as switzerland 's ciba-geigy and chiron corp. of <unk> calif <eos>
 officials for the two concerns which are bidding c$ N a share for connaught could n't be reached for comment <eos>
 french state-owned rhone-poulenc s.a. holds N N of merieux <eos>
 <unk> international inc. said it canceled plans for a <unk> swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock and added that it expects to publicly offer about N million common shares <eos>
 the company said it planned to offer an <unk> number of common shares in exchange for the N shares of its preferred stock outstanding <eos>
 the exchange ratio was never established <eos>
 <unk> said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange <eos>
 the <unk> concern said however that in january N it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock <eos>
 <unk> suspended its <unk> payment in october N and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in <unk> about $ N million but will do so some time in the future <eos>
 additionally the company said it filed with the securities and exchange commission for the proposed offering of N million shares of common stock expected to be offered in november <eos>
 the company said salomon brothers inc. and howard weil <unk> <unk> inc. underwriters for the offering were granted an option to buy as much as an additional N million shares to cover <unk> <eos>
 proceeds will be used to eliminate and restructure bank debt <eos>
 <unk> currently has approximately N million common shares outstanding <eos>
 earnings for most of the nation 's major pharmaceutical makers are believed to have moved ahead <unk> in the third quarter as companies with newer <unk> prescription drugs fared especially well <eos>
 for the third consecutive quarter however most of the companies ' revenues were battered by adverse foreign-currency <unk> as a result of the strong dollar abroad <eos>
 analysts said that merck & co. eli lilly & co. warner-lambert co. and the squibb corp. unit of bristol-myers squibb co. all benefited from strong sales of relatively new <unk> <unk> that provide wide profit margins <eos>
 less robust earnings at pfizer inc. and upjohn co. were attributed to those companies ' older products many of which face <unk> competition from generic drugs and other <unk> <eos>
 joseph <unk> an analyst with bear stearns & co. said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their <unk> businesses and instituted other cost savings such as consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs <eos>
 as a result major new products are having significant impact even on a company with very large revenues mr. <unk> said <eos>
 analysts said profit for the dozen or so big drug makers as a group is estimated to have climbed between N N and N N <eos>
 while that 's not spectacular neil <unk> an analyst with prudential <unk> said that the rate of growth will look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns downward <eos>
 mr. <unk> estimated that merck 's profit for the quarter rose by about N N propelled by sales of its <unk> of fast-growing prescription drugs including its <unk> drug <unk> a high blood pressure medicine <unk> <unk> an <unk> and <unk> an <unk> medication <eos>
 profit climbed even though merck 's sales were reduced by one to three percentage points as a result of the strong dollar mr. <unk> said <eos>
 in the third quarter of N merck earned $ N million or N cents a share <eos>
 in <unk> n.j. a merck spokesman said the company does n't make earnings projections <eos>
 mr. <unk> said he estimated that lilly 's earnings for the quarter jumped about N N largely because of the performance of its new <unk> <unk> <eos>
 the drug introduced last year is expected to generate sales of about $ N million this year <eos>
 it 's turning out to be a real blockbuster mr. <unk> said <eos>
 in last year 's third quarter lilly earned $ N million or $ N a share <eos>
 in indianapolis lilly declined comment <eos>
 several analysts said they expected warner-lambert 's profit also to increase by more than N N from $ N million or $ N a share it reported in the like period last year <eos>
 the company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shedding numerous companies with low profit margins <eos>
 the company 's lean operation analysts said allowed <unk> sales from its cholesterol drug <unk> to power earnings growth <eos>
 <unk> sales are expected to be about $ N million this year up from $ N million in N <eos>
 in morris plains n.j. a spokesman for the company said the analysts ' projections are in the <unk> <eos>
 squibb 's profit estimated by analysts to be about N N above the $ N million or $ N a share it earned in the third quarter of N was the result of especially strong sales of its <unk> drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease <eos>
 the company was officially merged with bristol-myers co. earlier this month <eos>
 bristol-myers declined to comment <eos>
 mr. <unk> of bear stearns said that schering-plough corp. 's expected profit rise of about N N to N N and <unk> 's expected profit increase of about N N are largely because those companies are really managed well <eos>
 <unk> earned $ N million or N cents a share while bristol-myers earned $ N million or N cents a share in the like period a year earlier <eos>
 in madison n.j. a spokesman for schering-plough said the company has no problems with the average estimate by a analysts that third-quarter earnings per share rose by about N N to $ N <eos>
 the company expects to achieve the N N increase in full-year earnings per share as it projected in the spring the spokesman said <eos>
 meanwhile analysts said pfizer 's recent string of lackluster quarterly performances continued as earnings in the quarter were expected to decline by about N N <eos>
 sales of pfizer 's important drugs <unk> for treating <unk> and <unk> a heart medicine have <unk> because of increased competition <eos>
 the strong dollar hurt pfizer a lot too mr. <unk> said <eos>
 in the third quarter last year pfizer earned $ N million or $ N a share <eos>
 in new york the company declined comment <eos>
 analysts said they expected upjohn 's profit to be flat or rise by only about N N to N N as compared with $ N million or N cents a share it earned a year ago <eos>
 upjohn 's <unk> drugs are <unk> a <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <eos>
 sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws restricting the <unk> of certain <unk> <unk> and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs <eos>
 also the company 's <unk> drug <unk> is selling well at about $ N million for the year but the company 's profit from the drug has been reduced by upjohn 's expensive print and television campaigns for advertising analysts said <eos>
 in <unk> mich. upjohn declined comment <eos>

 gulf resources & chemical corp. said it agreed to pay $ N million as part of an accord with the environmental protection agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a <unk> <unk> the company formerly operated in idaho <eos>
 in N the epa notified gulf resources which was a <unk> of the <unk> that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal superfund program <eos>
 the <unk> area is <unk> with lead <unk> and other metals <eos>
 gulf resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a <unk> concern potentially <unk> it from liability for the <unk> 's cleanup costs <eos>
 the company said that as part of its agreement with the epa it made certain voluntary <unk> with respect to <unk> transactions entered into after the reorganization <eos>
 the company which issued a statement on the agreement late friday said that $ N million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $ N will be recognized in its N third-quarter statement <eos>
 the agreement and consent <unk> are subject to court approval the company said <eos>
 gulf resources added that it will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the superfund law <eos>
 under the agreement gulf must give the u.s. government N days ' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock <eos>
 the company 's net worth can not fall below $ N million after the dividends are issued <eos>
 the terms of that agreement only become effective the date of gulf 's reorganization which we anticipate will occur sometime in early N said lawrence r. mehl gulf 's general counsel <eos>
 in addition gulf must give the government N days ' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $ N million that are made to the <unk> holding company <eos>
 gulf 's net worth after those transaction must be at least $ N million <eos>
 separately the company said it expects to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early N to vote on its proposed reorganization <eos>
 many of the nation 's <unk> executives <unk> friday 's market plunge as an overdue <unk> for speculators and takeover players <eos>
 assuming that the market does n't head into a <unk> free fall some executives think friday 's action could prove a <unk> of good news as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be <unk> <eos>
 this is a reaction to <unk> lbo <unk> rather than to any fundamentals said john young chairman of hewlett-packard co. whose shares dropped $ N to $ N <eos>
 if we get rid of a lot of that nonsense it will be a big plus <eos>
 a few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the business council a group that meets to discuss national issues were only too happy to <unk> their criticism <eos>
 people wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs do something about takeovers do something about donald trump said rand <unk> chairman of itt corp. whose stock dropped $ N <eos>
 where 's the leadership <eos>
 where 's the guy who can say enough is enough <eos>
 the executives were <unk> <unk> by the plunge even though it <unk> billions of dollars off the value of their companies and millions off their personal fortunes <eos>
 i 'm not going to worry about one day 's decline said kenneth <unk> digital equipment corp. president who was <unk> <unk> through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the <unk> here after his company 's shares plunged $ N to close at $ N <eos>
 i did n't bother calling anybody i did n't even turn on tv <eos>
 there has n't been any fundamental change in the economy added john <unk> whose procter & gamble co. took an $ N slide to close at $ N <eos>
 the fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this wo n't be a problem <eos>
 of course established corporate <unk> often tend to <unk> the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists <eos>
 indeed one chief executive who was downright <unk> by friday 's events was robert crandall chairman of amr corp. the parent of american airlines and the target of a takeover offer by mr. trump <eos>
 asked whether friday 's action could help him avoid being <unk> by the new york real estate <unk> mr. crandall <unk> broadly and said no comment <eos>
 on friday morning before the market 's sell-off the business leaders issued a report predicting the economy would grow at roughly an inflation-adjusted N N annual rate through next year then accelerate <unk> in N <eos>
 of the N economists who worked on the business council forecast only two projected periods of decline in the nation 's output over the next two years and in both <unk> the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession said lewis <unk> chairman of j.p. morgan & co. and vice chairman of the business council <eos>
 the real estate slump that 's pushing down the price of new york office space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real estate market <eos>
 in manhattan <unk> store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill <eos>
 retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy turmoil in their own industries and a belief that <unk> have not yet hit bottom <eos>
 there is an <unk> amount of space available says faith <unk> senior vice president at <unk> associates store leasing inc <eos>
 there are about N stores for rent up from a more typical range of N to N <eos>
 this further <unk> retailers she says <eos>
 they wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down <eos>
 is this the wrong time to open a store <eos>
 who is going to be in the space next door <eos>
 in addition ms. <unk> says tenants usually can negotiate to pay <unk> that are about <unk> lower than <unk> ' initial asking price <eos>
 a handful of hot retail locations such as the <unk> street and madison and fifth avenue areas have been able to sustain what many see as <unk> <unk> <eos>
 and in some neighborhoods <unk> have merely hit a <unk> <eos>
 but on average manhattan retail <unk> have dropped N N to N N in the past six months alone experts say <eos>
 that follows a more <unk> decline in the prior six months after manhattan <unk> had run up rapidly since N <eos>
 the same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing <eos>
 as businesses contract or <unk> the number of employees who might use retail services <unk> says edward a. <unk> senior vice president of helmsley <unk> inc <eos>
 he says financial problems <unk> electronics fur and furniture companies key categories in the local retail economy have further <unk> the market <eos>
 hardest hit are what he calls secondary sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents <eos>
 in these locations mr. <unk> says retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and <unk> have remained steady or in some cases have declined <eos>
 weakness in the restaurant industry which is leaving retail space vacant <unk> the problem for <unk> <eos>
 it is also no comfort to <unk> and small new york retailers when the future of larger department stores which <unk> retail neighborhoods are in doubt <eos>
 hooker corp. parent of <unk> teller and b. altman 's is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and bloomingdale 's is for sale by its owner campeau corp <eos>
 the trend toward lower <unk> may seem surprising given that some communities in new york are <unk> the loss of favorite local businesses to high <unk> <eos>
 but despite the recent softening for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s when their leases were signed <eos>
 certainly the recent drop in prices does n't mean manhattan comes cheap <eos>
 new york retail <unk> still run well above the going rate in other u.s. cities <eos>
 madison and fifth <unk> and east <unk> street can command <unk> of up to $ N a square foot and $ N is not uncommon <eos>
 the thriving <unk> street area offers <unk> of about $ N a square foot as do <unk> locations along lower fifth avenue <eos>
 by contrast <unk> in the best retail locations in boston san francisco and chicago rarely top $ N a square foot <eos>
 and <unk> on beverly hills ' <unk> drive generally do n't exceed about $ N a square foot <eos>

 when justice william <unk> marks the start of his <unk> year on the supreme court today the occasion will differ sharply from previous <unk> of his tenure <eos>
 for the first time the <unk> justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent rather than as a force in the high court 's majority <eos>
 this role reversal holds true as well for his three liberal and moderate allies justices <unk> marshall harry <unk> and john stevens <eos>
 but are these four players three of them in their <unk> ready to assume a different role after N years <unk> of service on the high court <eos>
 every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role and the <unk> that go with it but in different ways <eos>
 justices <unk> and stevens appear <unk> about it justices marshall and <unk> appear fighting mad <eos>
 the four justices are no newcomers to dissent often joining forces in the past decade to <unk> the court 's conservative <unk> <eos>
 but always in years past they have <unk> the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to <unk> out a number of major victories in civil rights and <unk> cases <eos>
 now however as the court 's new <unk> conservative majority continues to <unk> victories for the liberals are rare <eos>
 the change is most dramatic for justice <unk> the last <unk> of the <unk> liberal majority under chief justice <unk> warren <eos>
 in the seven supreme court terms from the fall of N through the spring of N the <unk> of the warren court 's power justice <unk> cast only N <unk> votes in N cases decided by the court <eos>
 last term alone he cast N <unk> votes in N decisions with the contentious <unk> ruling as his only big victory <eos>
 but justice <unk> <unk> his new role strongly defending the importance of <unk> in a N speech <eos>
 each time the court <unk> an issue the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to <unk> the result he said <eos>
 moreover in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s he knew that the tables might turn in the future <eos>
 he has said that he now knows how justice john <unk> felt a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent <unk> from the warren court 's opinions <eos>
 associates of <unk> justice marshall say he was depressed about the court 's direction last spring but is <unk> about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights <eos>
 we could sweep it under the <unk> and hide it but i 'm not going to do it he said in a speech last month <eos>
 he like justice <unk> considers <unk> highly important for the future a point that has n't escaped legal scholars <eos>
 harvard law school professor laurence tribe says there is a <unk> flavor to current <unk> <eos>
 the <unk> in the warren court he says appeared to be writing for the short-term suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon <eos>
 <unk> and marshall are speaking in their <unk> to a more distant future he says <eos>
 justice <unk> who will turn N next month also seems <unk> about his new role <eos>
 associates say he takes some <unk> more personally than his colleagues especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his N opinion roe vs. wade <eos>
 friends and associates who saw justice <unk> during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years <eos>
 and his outlook improved after successful <unk> surgery in august <eos>
 but his level of frustration showed in a recent <unk> speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in chicago <eos>
 he concluded his remarks by <unk> <unk> and at some length according to those present the late martin <unk> king 's famous i have a dream speech from the N march on washington <eos>
 justice stevens N is probably the most <unk> of the <unk> about his role in part because he may be the least liberal of the four but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others <eos>
 if the role these four <unk> are assuming is a familiar one in modern supreme court history it also <unk> in an important way from recent history court watchers say <eos>
 the <unk> of the warren court were often defending a legal <unk> that they inherited says prof. <unk> dick howard of the university of virginia law school but the <unk> today are defending a <unk> that they created <eos>
 the government sold the deposits of four savings-and-loan institutions in its first wave of sales of big sick thrifts but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth <eos>
 the four s&ls were sold to large banks as was the case with most of the N previous transactions initiated by the resolution trust corp. since it was created in the s&l bailout legislation two months ago <eos>
 two of the four big thrifts were sold to ncnb corp. charlotte n.c. which has aggressively expanded its markets particularly in texas and florida <eos>
 a canadian bank bought another thrift in the first rtc transaction with a foreign bank <eos>
 under these deals the rtc sells just the deposits and the healthy assets <eos>
 these <unk> transactions leave the bulk of bad assets mostly real estate with the government to be sold later <eos>
 in these four for instance the rtc is stuck with $ N billion in bad assets <eos>
 <unk> paid premiums ranging from N N to N N for the deposits and branch systems roughly in line with what analysts were expecting <eos>
 the buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks as has been the case with previous deals <eos>
 after that the buyers may <unk> the rates paid by the former thrifts <eos>
 but it 's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps <eos>
 ncnb for example has been one of the highest rate <unk> in the texas market and in florida rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities <eos>
 the rtc had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines but the delays illustrate the tough <unk> facing the agency <eos>
 these thrifts are <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> an industry consultant based in <unk> va <eos>
 for example the delay in selling people 's heritage savings <unk> kan. with $ N billion in assets has forced the rtc to consider selling off the thrift <unk> instead of as a whole institution <eos>
 ncnb continued its <unk> into the florida and texas markets <eos>
 ncnb will acquire university federal savings association houston which had assets of $ N billion <eos>
 ncnb texas national bank will pay the rtc a premium of $ N million for $ N billion in deposits <eos>
 as a measure of the <unk> to which the texas real estate market has <unk> the rtc will pay $ N billion to ncnb to take $ N million of bad assets <eos>
 ncnb also acquired freedom savings & loan association tampa fla. which had total assets of $ N million <eos>
 ncnb will pay the rtc a premium of $ N million for $ N billion in deposits <eos>
 ncnb will also acquire $ N million of freedom 's assets from the rtc which will require $ N million in assistance <eos>
 meridian bancorp inc. reading pa. will acquire hill financial savings association red hill pa. which had $ N billion in assets <eos>
 meridian will pay a premium of $ N million to assume $ N billion in deposits <eos>
 it will also purchase $ N million of the thrift 's assets with $ N billion in rtc assistance <eos>
 in the first rtc transaction with a foreign buyer royal <unk> ltd. toronto will acquire pacific savings bank costa mesa calif. which had $ N million in assets <eos>
 royal <unk> will pay the rtc $ N million to assume $ N million in deposits <eos>
 it will also purchase $ N million in assets and receive $ N million in assistance from the rtc <eos>

 time magazine in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise <unk> <eos>
 in an announcement to its staff last week executives at time warner inc. 's weekly magazine said time will dramatically <unk> its use of electronic <unk> such as telephones in television subscription drives cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by N to four million and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ N to $ N <eos>
 in a related development the <unk> for the fourth year in a row said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in N a full <unk> page in the magazine costs about $ N <eos>
 however because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered ad rates will be effectively N N higher per subscriber according to richard <unk> time associate publisher <eos>
 time is following the course of some other <unk> magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing <unk> that maintaining artificially high and expensive <unk> is the way to draw advertisers <eos>
 in recent years reader 's digest new york times co. 's mccall 's and most recently news corp. 's tv guide have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers <eos>
 deep discounts in <unk> and offers of free <unk> <unk> and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the <unk> world of magazine <unk> <eos>
 but time as part of the more <unk> time warner wants to <unk> itself away from expensive <unk> <eos>
 besides time executives think selling a news magazine with a <unk> radio is <unk> <eos>
 <unk> just give people the wrong image said mr. <unk> <eos>
 that perception takes the focus off the magazine <eos>
 time magazine executives predictably <unk> the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers <eos>
 what we are doing is <unk> out the readers who are only <unk> related to the magazine and do n't really read it said mr. <unk> <eos>
 we are trying to create quality and involvement <eos>
 however time executives used the same explanation when in october N the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from N million to N million <eos>
 and time 's paid circulation according to audit bureau of <unk> dropped N N to N in the six months ended june N N <eos>
 still time 's move is being received well once again <eos>
 it 's <unk> for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more said michael <unk> national media director at bozell inc. ad agency <eos>
 a few drops in circulation are of no consequence <eos>
 it 's not a show of weakness they are improving the quality of circulation while <unk> their profits <eos>
 mr. <unk> said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away <eos>
 the question is how much are we getting from each reader said mr. <unk> <eos>
 time 's rivals <unk> washington post co. 's newsweek and u.s. news & world report are less <unk> on electronic <unk> and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases <eos>
 both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for N within a month <eos>
 when the news broke of an attempted coup in panama two weeks ago sen. christopher dodd called the state department for a briefing <eos>
 they said follow <unk> he told reporters <eos>
 that shows how far ted turner 's cable news network has come since its birth nine years ago when it was considered the <unk> of television news <eos>
 it is bigger faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks <eos>
 its niche as the network of record during major crises draws elite audiences around the world <eos>
 but for all its success <unk> has hit a <unk> <eos>
 although <unk> <unk> when big news breaks it <unk> during periods of calm <eos>
 <unk> executives worry that the network 's <unk> but <unk> news format may be getting <unk> and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives <unk> for news and information on cable-tv <eos>
 just the fact we 're on N hours is no longer <unk> says ed turner <unk> 's executive vice president news gathering and no <unk> to ted turner <eos>
 you ca n't live on that <eos>
 so <unk> a unit of atlanta-based turner broadcasting system inc. is trying to <unk> itself as a primary channel or what people in the television industry call a top of mind network <eos>
 tonight to kick off the effort <unk> will premiere its first prime-time <unk> in years an <unk> show at N p.m eastern time to air <unk> against the network <unk> <eos>
 the show will be <unk> by bernard shaw and <unk> <unk> a <unk> former texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism <eos>
 the new show is perhaps the <unk> in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more <unk> signature programming with <unk> stars <eos>
 to <unk> itself <unk> is also expanding international coverage and adding a second <unk> program <eos>
 it is paying higher salaries after years of <unk> to lure and keep experienced staffers <eos>
 and it is <unk> on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large <unk> team <eos>
 the next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables says jon <unk> executive vice president of headline news <unk> 's sister network <eos>
 but that wo n't be easy <eos>
 networks like other consumer products develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy to change <eos>
 it also takes money that <unk> has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see <eos>
 and the cable-tv operators <unk> 's distributors and part owners like things just the way they are <eos>
 the <unk> bid is aimed at <unk> 's <unk> <unk> and what may happen to it as the cable-tv news market grows more competitive <eos>
 already <unk> is facing stronger competition from financial news network inc. and general electric co. 's consumer news and business channel both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future <eos>
 in addition many cable-tv systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations <eos>
 <unk> wants to change its viewers ' habits <eos>
 its watchers are on the whole a <unk> group of <unk> <unk> and news <unk> who spend an average of just N minutes a day watching <unk> according to audience research <eos>
 that 's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks <eos>
 the brief attention viewers give <unk> could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data and advertising become more important to cable-tv channels <eos>
 <unk> 's <unk> habits have been <unk> by its format <eos>
 its strategy in the past has been to serve as a tv wire service <eos>
 it focused on building up its news bureaus around the world so as events took place it could go live <unk> and longer than other networks <eos>
 it filled its daily schedule with <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but the shows <unk> little in content <unk> or look <eos>
 now the push is on for <unk> shows <eos>
 our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity says paul <unk> <unk> executive vice president for programming <eos>
 <unk> <unk> is adding a <unk> show in the morning because surveys show its <unk> hour in the afternoon is among its most <unk> programs in viewers ' minds says mr. <unk> <eos>
 and it is exploring other original programs similar to its larry king live and <unk> talk shows which executives hope will keep people <unk> in <eos>
 then there 's the world today the prime-time <unk> featuring mr. shaw and ms. <unk> <eos>
 until now <unk> has featured its hollywood <unk> show during the key evening period <eos>
 but N N of the <unk> households that watch news do so between N p.m. and N p.m. the network discovered so <unk> wants in <eos>
 mr. <unk> says the <unk> team will probably do two live interviews a day with most of the program at least for now appearing similar to <unk> 's other <unk> <eos>
 some in the industry are skeptical <eos>
 i find it hard to <unk> of people switching over to <unk> for what at least in the public 's mind is the same news says <unk> frank the former <unk> president of nbc news and <unk> of the <unk> report <eos>
 the evening news is also slated as <unk> 's stage for its big push into <unk> journalism <eos>
 in august the network hired <unk> producer <unk> hill the former head of news <unk> at abc <eos>
 she 's <unk> a staff of about N <unk> reporters who will produce weekly <unk> segments with an eye toward breaking big stories <eos>
 <unk> executives hope the <unk> created by such <unk> will generate excitement for its <unk> programs in the way N minutes did so well for cbs <eos>
 that 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical <unk> will follow through with its <unk> commitment especially after it sees the cost of producing <unk> pieces <eos>
 they 've never shown any <unk> to spend money on production says michael <unk> a senior producer with <unk> <unk> who notes that <unk> is <unk> to his job <eos>
 the network 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards resulting in a <unk> work force <eos>
 <unk> recently gave most employees raises of as much as N N but they 're still drastically <unk> compared with the networks <eos>
 says mr. <unk> <unk> is my wire service they 're on top of everything <eos>
 but to improve they 've really got to make the investment in people <eos>
 in any case <unk> operators have reason to fear any <unk> with <unk> 's format <eos>
 they market cable-tv on the very <unk> opportunities <unk> seeks to discourage <eos>
 we would obviously be upset if those kinds of services <unk> into more <unk> <unk> programming says robert <unk> senior vice president programming of continental <unk> inc. which holds a N N stake in turner broadcasting <eos>
 the second u.s. circuit court of appeals opinion in the <unk> <unk> case did not <unk> the position pennzoil co. took in its dispute with texaco contrary to your sept. N article court backs texaco 's view in pennzoil case too late <eos>
 the fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound <eos>
 in the <unk> litigation the courts found pennzoil and <unk> oil intended to be bound in <unk> <unk> they found there was no intention to be bound <eos>
 <unk> the principle in the cases is the same <eos>
 but the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts <eos>
 and the facts as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits were different <eos>
 when you suggest otherwise you leave the <unk> of reporting and enter the <unk> of speculation <eos>

 valley federal savings & loan association said imperial corp. of america withdrew from regulators its application to buy five valley federal branches leaving the transaction in limbo <eos>
 the broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at imperial corp. whose spokesman said the company withdrew its application from the federal office of thrift supervision because of an informal notice that imperial 's thrift unit failed to meet community reinvestment act requirements <eos>
 the community reinvestment act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received <eos>
 the transaction announced in august included about $ N million in deposits at the five outlets in california 's san <unk> valley <eos>
 terms were n't disclosed but valley federal had said it expected to post a modest pretax gain and to save about $ N million in operating costs annually <eos>
 valley federal said friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with imperial corp. which said it is attempting to meet community reinvestment act requirements <eos>
 valley federal with assets of $ N billion is based in van <unk> <eos>
 imperial corp. based in san diego is the parent of imperial savings & loan <eos>
 in the first six months of the year it posted a net loss of $ N million <eos>
 call it the we 're too broke to fight defense <eos>
 lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new <unk> in their efforts to <unk> suits filed by borrowers developers and creditors <eos>
 the thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits <unk> N to N in texas alone should be dismissed as <unk> because neither the s&ls nor the <unk> federal savings and loan insurance corp. has the money to pay judgments <eos>
 though the argument may have a <unk> ring to it even the s&l lawyers concede there 's little precedent to back their position <eos>
 still one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to <unk> the notion and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law <eos>
 the dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court <unk> in texas and reducing the <unk> 's massive legal bills which topped $ N million last year <eos>

 september 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still <unk> and the <unk> over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge friday <eos>
 after falling for three consecutive months the producer price index for finished goods shot up N N last month the labor department reported friday as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer <eos>
 although the report which was released before the stock market opened did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the dow jones industrial average analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline <eos>
 analysts immediately viewed the price data the <unk> inflation news in months as evidence that the federal reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped <eos>
 further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the fed from easing credit the commerce department reported friday that retail sales grew N N in september to $ N billion <eos>
 that rise came on top of a N N gain in august and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy <eos>
 i think the friday report combined with the actions of the fed weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy said robert <unk> chief economist at northern trust co. in chicago <eos>
 but economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers <eos>
 the overall N N increase is serious in itself but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy the producer price index still increased by N N said gordon <unk> an economist at the national association of manufacturers <eos>
 but sung won <unk> chief economist at <unk> corp. in minneapolis blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the september jump <eos>
 i would say this is not bad news this is a <unk> he said <eos>
 the core rate is not really out of line <eos>
 all year energy prices have <unk> the producer price index which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods <eos>
 inflation <unk> has fallen back from its <unk> pace last winter when a steep <unk> in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates <eos>
 energy prices then plummeted through the summer causing the index to decline for three consecutive months <eos>
 overall the index has climbed at a N N compound annual rate since the start of the year the labor department said <eos>
 while far more <unk> than the pace at the beginning of the year that is still a <unk> rise than the N N increase for all of N <eos>
 moreover this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month when energy prices <unk> up N N after plunging N N in august <eos>
 some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain <eos>
 analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index but the N N climb was higher than most anticipated <eos>
 i think the <unk> in inflation is going to continue for a few months said john <unk> chief economist at bell <unk> <unk> a washington economic forecasting firm <eos>
 he predicted that inflation will moderate next year saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide <eos>
 but <unk> van <unk> president of the national association of <unk> said that last month 's rise is n't as bad an <unk> as the N N figure suggests <eos>
 if you examine the data carefully the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods he explained <eos>
 passenger car prices jumped N N in september after climbing N N in august and declining in the late spring and summer <eos>
 many analysts said the september increase was a one-time event coming as dealers introduced their N models <eos>
 although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations car prices rose beyond the <unk> autumn increase <eos>
 prices for capital equipment rose a hefty N N in september while prices for home electronic equipment fell N N <eos>
 food prices declined N N after climbing N N in august <eos>
 meanwhile the retail sales report showed that car sales rose N N in september to $ N billion <eos>
 but at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices analysts said <eos>
 sales at general merchandise stores rose N N after declining N N in august while sales of building materials fell N N after rising N N <eos>
 producer prices for intermediate goods grew N N in september after dropping for three consecutive months <eos>
 prices for crude goods an array of raw materials jumped N N after declining N N in august and <unk> up N N in july <eos>
 here are the labor department 's producer price indexes N <unk> N for september before seasonal adjustment and the percentage changes from september N <eos>
 <unk> financial corp. said it expects to report a loss of at least $ N million to $ N million for the third quarter <eos>
 in the year-earlier period <unk> had net income of $ N but no per-share earnings <eos>
 <unk> 's president and chief executive officer john <unk> said the loss stems from several factors <eos>
 he said nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $ N million from $ N million between june and september <eos>
 approximately N N of the total <unk> of nonperforming commercial real estate assets <eos>
 <unk> <unk> estimated that it will provide between $ N million and $ N million for credit losses in the third quarter <eos>
 <unk> added that significant additional loan-loss provisions may be required by federal regulators as part of the current annual examination of city federal savings bank <unk> 's primary subsidiary based in <unk> n.j <eos>
 city federal operates N banking offices in new jersey and florida <eos>
 mr. <unk> said <unk> will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions <unk> themselves of such bonds <eos>
 that action <unk> said will result in a charge against third-quarter results of approximately $ N million <eos>
 <unk> also said it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan <unk> operations outside its principal markets in new jersey and florida and as a result is taking a charge for discontinued operations <eos>
 all these actions mr. <unk> said will result in a loss of $ N million to $ N million for the third quarter <eos>
 he added however depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages <unk> and the outcome of the annual examination of city federal currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range <eos>
 centrust savings bank said federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock indicating that regulators ' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened <eos>
 in a statement miami-based centrust said the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and apparent losses in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends <eos>
 regulators also ordered centrust to stop buying back the preferred stock <eos>
 david l. paul chairman and chief executive officer criticized the federal office of thrift supervision which issued the <unk> saying it was inappropriate and based on insufficient reasons <eos>
 he said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision <eos>
 the suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution 's health <eos>
 in march regulators labeled centrust a troubled institution largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses <eos>
 in the same month the office of thrift supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track <eos>
 for the nine months ended june N centrust had a net loss of $ N million compared with year-earlier net income of $ N million <eos>
 centrust which is florida 's largest thrift holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation <eos>
 since april it has <unk> its high-yield bond holdings to about $ N million from $ N billion <eos>
 mr. paul said only about $ N million of the current holdings are <unk> securities registered with the securities and exchange commission <eos>
 the remainder he said are commercial loan <unk> or private <unk> that are n't filed with the sec and do n't have a ready market <eos>
 centrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market <unk> for the junk bonds <eos>
 the office of thrift supervision has been <unk> centrust to provide current market values for its holdings but centrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative <unk> of the bonds and lack of a ready market <eos>
 regulators have become increasingly <unk> about centrust 's and other thrifts ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market <eos>
 the legislation requires thrifts to <unk> themselves of junk bonds in the new <unk> regulatory climate <eos>
 in american stock exchange composite trading friday centrust common shares closed at $ N down N cents <eos>
 in a statement friday mr. paul challenged the regulators ' decision saying the thrift 's operating losses and apparent junk-bond losses have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank <eos>
 he also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds <eos>
 in the third quarter for instance centrust added $ N million to its general reserves <eos>
 mr. paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with <unk> centrust 's request to sell N of its N branches to great western bank a unit of great western financial corp. based in beverly hills calif <eos>
 the branch sale is the centerpiece of centrust 's strategy to transform itself into a traditional s&l from a <unk> institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits according to mr. paul <eos>
 most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction which was announced in july long before now <eos>
 many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal <eos>
 branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution <eos>
 centrust however <unk> the branch sale saying it would bring in $ N million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ N billion from $ N billion <eos>
 it said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $ N million or about N N of assets from a negative $ N million as of sept. N thus bringing centrust close to regulatory standards <eos>
 centrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ N million <eos>
 critics however say the branch sale will make centrust more dependent than ever on <unk> deposits and junk bonds <eos>
 mr. paul <unk> that he intends to further <unk> the size of centrust by not renewing more than $ N billion of <unk> certificates of deposit when they come due <eos>
 the thrift is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate as required under the new thrift law <eos>
 on a recent saturday night in the midst of west germany 's most popular prime-time show a <unk> bet the host that she could name any of N different <unk> after just one <unk> while <unk> <eos>
 the woman won the bet <eos>
 but perhaps even more remarkable the <unk> <unk> <unk> make a bet regularly wins the top <unk> in the country 's tv ratings sometimes drawing as many as N N of west german households <eos>
 as the N economic integration approaches europe 's cultural <unk> have taken to the <unk> against american cultural <unk> threatening to impose quotas against such pop <unk> as dallas miami vice and l.a. law <eos>
 but much of what the europeans want to protect seems every bit as <unk> as what they are trying to keep out <eos>
 the most <unk> opposition to american tv imports has come from french television and movie producers who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full N N of europe 's tv shows be produced in europe <eos>
 so far the french have failed to win enough broad-based support to prevail <eos>
 a <unk> through the television listings and a few <unk> of the european television dial suggest one reason why <eos>
 while there are some popular action and drama series few <unk> the high culture and <unk> production values one might expect <eos>
 more european air time is filled with <unk> game shows variety hours movies and talk shows many of which are authorized <unk> of their american counterparts <eos>
 one of france 's most popular saturday night programs features <unk> seeking out their <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <eos>
 a <unk> game show has as its host a belgian <unk> to be italian <eos>
 one of italy 's favorite shows <unk> a <unk> variety show is so popular that viewers <unk> to buy a <unk> product <unk> <unk> whose <unk> were sung each week by <unk> <unk> even though the product did n't exist <eos>
 <unk> the <unk> <unk> on another typical evening of fun on <unk> <unk> a <unk> won a bet with the show 's host thomas <unk> that he could identify N german <unk> over the telephone <eos>
 a celebrity guest u.s. ambassador to west germany richard burt also won a bet that someone could pile up $ N worth of quarters on a <unk> coin <eos>
 mr. burt nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost agreeing to spend a day with west german foreign minister <unk> <unk> <unk> and selling their combined weight in potato <unk> <eos>
 if this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the <unk> barriers it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get <eos>
 european programs usually target only their own local audience and often only a small portion of that <eos>
 <unk> in germany or italy rarely make it even to france or great britain and almost never show up on u.s. screens <eos>
 attempts to produce <unk> programs have generally resulted in disappointment <eos>
 one annual <unk> the <unk> <unk> song contest featuring <unk> <unk> from each of N european countries has been described as the world 's most boring tv show <eos>
 another <unk> <unk> <unk> where <unk> from <unk> european countries make <unk> of themselves performing <unk> tasks is a hit in france <eos>
 a <unk> <unk> under the title almost anything goes <unk> fast <eos>
 for the most part what 's made here stays here and for good reason <eos>
 the <unk> of the british crop the literary <unk> that are shown on u.s. public television as <unk> theater make up a relatively small part of british air time <eos>
 most british programming is more of an acquired taste <eos>
 there is for instance one man and his dog a <unk> contest among sheep dogs <eos>
 also <unk> to the british are hours of <unk> <unk> even more hours of lawn bowling <unk> and still more hours of <unk> <unk> <eos>
 european drama has had better though still mixed fortunes <eos>
 the most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns <eos>
 a french <unk> of dallas called <unk> and set in a french <unk> had a good run in france which ended after the female lead was injured in a <unk> auto accident <eos>
 <unk> black forest clinic a kind of german <unk> elsewhere set in a health <unk> is popular in germany and has spread into france <eos>
 italy 's most popular series is a drama called la <unk> or the <unk> which <unk> the fight of an <unk> young investigator in <unk> against the mafia <eos>
 it was <unk> news in italy earlier this year when the <unk> inspector was <unk> down in the series <eos>
 spain 's most popular <unk> this year was <unk> the story of an aging <unk> <eos>
 the trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular with american programs second says brian <unk> a former director of programs for the british broadcasting corp <eos>
 given a choice everybody will watch a <unk> show <eos>
 but frequently there is n't much choice <eos>
 thus europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own programs with broader appeal <eos>
 we 've basically got to start from <unk> to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see concedes <unk> young head of britain 's national film theatre school <eos>
 while some in the u.s. contend that advertising is the <unk> of television here many believe that its absence is to blame for the european tv industry 's sluggish development <eos>
 until recently national governments in europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising <eos>
 since production costs were guaranteed it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into <unk> as most american programs are <eos>
 but not much money was spent on the shows either a situation that encouraged <unk> talk and game shows while discouraging <unk> <unk> <eos>
 now however commercial channels are coming to most european countries and at the same time satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly <eos>
 just last week greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels <eos>
 the result is a new and huge appetite for programming <eos>
 but perhaps to the <unk> of those calling for quotas most of this <unk> is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most <unk> programming now available reruns usually of shows made in the u.s. <eos>
 sky channel a <unk> venture of <unk> press <unk> rupert murdoch offers what must be a <unk> cultural mix to most of its audience <eos>

 british aerospace plc and france 's <unk> s.a. said they are <unk> an agreement to merge their <unk> divisions greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors <eos>
 the N joint venture which may be dubbed <unk> would have combined annual sales of at least # N billion $ N billion and would be among the world 's largest missile makers <eos>
 after two years of talks plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek french and british government clearance <eos>
 the companies hope for a final agreement by year-end <eos>
 the venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies and help make them a leading force in european defense contracting <eos>
 in recent months a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have <unk> the <unk> world of european arms manufacture <eos>

 just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy ferranti international signal plc a smaller british defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a u.s. unit <eos>
 the sudden <unk> of british aerospace and <unk> traditionally bitter competitors for middle east and third world weapons contracts is <unk> controversy in western europe 's defense industry <eos>
 most threatened by closer british <unk> ties would be their respective national rivals including <unk> s.a. in france and britain 's general electric co. plc <eos>
 but neither <unk> nor <unk> unrelated to stamford <unk> general electric co. are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces <eos>
 yesterday a source close to <unk> confirmed that his company may join the ferranti fight as part of a possible consortium that would bid against british aerospace and <unk> <eos>
 companies with which <unk> has had talks about a possible joint ferranti bid include <unk> britain 's <unk> group plc west germany 's daimler-benz ag and france 's dassault group <eos>
 but it may be weeks before <unk> and its potential partners decide whether to bid the source indicated <eos>
 <unk> plans first to study ferranti 's financial accounts which auditors recently said included # N million in <unk> contracts at a u.s. unit international signal & control group with which ferranti merged last year <eos>
 also any <unk> bid might be blocked by british antitrust regulators ferranti is <unk> 's main competitor on several key <unk> contracts and its purchase by <unk> may <unk> british defense ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry <eos>
 a consortium bid however would <unk> <unk> 's direct role in ferranti and might consequently <unk> ministry officials <eos>
 a british aerospace spokeswoman appeared <unk> by the prospect of a fight with <unk> for ferranti competition is the name of the game she said <eos>
 at least one potential <unk> partner <unk> insists it is n't interested in ferranti <eos>
 we have nothing to say about this affair which does n't concern us a <unk> official said sunday <eos>
 the missile venture the british aerospace spokeswoman said is a needed response to the new environment in defense contracting <eos>
 for both thomson and british aerospace earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly <unk> defense ministries and middle east sales a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices <eos>
 the venture 's importance for thomson is great <eos>
 thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other europeans <eos>
 the european defense industry is consolidating for instance west germany 's siemens ag recently joined <unk> in a takeover of britain 's <unk> co. and daimler-benz agreed to buy <unk> <unk> g.m.b <unk> <eos>
 in missiles thomson is already <unk> by british aerospace and by its home rival france 's <unk> s.a. to better compete thomson officials say they need a partnership <eos>

 <unk> pipe line co. said it will delay a proposed <unk> N million <unk> us$ N million expansion of its system because canada 's output of crude oil is shrinking <eos>
 <unk> canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major <unk> of crude to the u.s. said revised industry forecasts indicate that canadian oil output will total about N million barrels a day by N N N lower than a previous estimate <eos>
 canadian crude production averaged about N million barrels a day during N 's first half about N N below the N level <eos>
 the capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas said ronald <unk> vice president for government and industry relations with <unk> 's parent <unk> energy inc <eos>
 mr. <unk> said volume on <unk> 's system is down about N N since january and is expected to fall further making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s <eos>
 there has been a swing of the <unk> back to the gas side he said <eos>
 many of canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil and have shifted their exploration and development budgets <unk> <eos>
 the number of active drilling <unk> in canada is down N N from a year ago and the number of completed oil wells is down more than that due to the increasing focus on gas exploration said robert <unk> manager of crude oil with calgary 's independent petroleum association of canada an industry group <eos>
 mr. <unk> said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature conventional fields in western canada <eos>
 <unk> <unk> about N N of all crude produced in western canada and almost N N of <unk> 's total volume consists of light crude <eos>
 nearly all of the crude oil that canada exports to the u.s. is <unk> on <unk> 's system whose main line runs from <unk> to major u.s. and canadian cities in the great <unk> region including chicago <unk> toronto and montreal <eos>
 canada 's current oil exports to the u.s. total about N barrels a day or about N N of net u.s. crude imports said john <unk> president of the new york-based petroleum industry research foundation <eos>
 that ranks canada as the <unk> source of imported crude behind saudi arabia <unk> and mexico <eos>
 mr. <unk> said canada 's declining crude output combined with the <unk> output of u.s. crude will help intensify u.s. reliance on oil from overseas particularly the middle east <eos>
 it 's very much a growing concern <eos>
 but when something is inevitable you learn to live with it he said <eos>
 mr. <unk> stressed that the delay of <unk> 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase u.s. <unk> on offshore crude however since canadian imports are limited in any case by canada 's falling output <eos>
 under terms of its proposed <unk> expansion which would have required regulatory approval <unk> intended to add N barrels a day of additional capacity to its system beginning with a modest expansion by N <eos>
 the system currently has a capacity of N million barrels a day <eos>
 inland steel industries inc. expects to report that third-quarter earnings dropped more than N N from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs <eos>
 in the second quarter the steelmaker had net income of $ N million or $ N a share including a pretax charge of $ N million related to the settlement of a suit on sales of $ N billion <eos>
 the company said normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by N tons in the latest quarter compared with the second quarter <eos>
 at the same time the <unk> business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses as well as higher labor costs under its new contract <eos>
 the <unk> business was hurt by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its joseph t. <unk> & son unit <eos>
 the company said it is beginning to see some <unk> improvements in both the <unk> and <unk> segments which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter <eos>
 inland said its third-quarter results will be announced later this week <eos>
 in the year-earlier third quarter when the industry was in the midst of a boom the company had net of $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion <eos>
 predicting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately <eos>
 take microsoft corp. the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether <eos>
 in july the company stunned wall street with the prediction that growth in the personal computer business overall would be only N N in N a modest increase when compared with the <unk> expansion of years past <eos>
 investors taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the <unk> reacted by selling the company 's stock which lost $ N that day to close at $ N in national over-the-counter trading <eos>
 but that was all of three months ago <eos>
 last week microsoft said it expects revenue for its first quarter ended sept. N to increase N N <eos>
 the announcement caused the company 's stock to surge $ N to close at $ N a share <eos>
 microsoft 's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for <unk> about the financial health of the computer firms <eos>
 it 's hard to know what to expect at this point said peter rogers an analyst at robertson <unk> & co <eos>
 the industry <unk> <unk> <eos>
 to illustrate mr. rogers said that of the N <unk> firms he follows half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year 's results and half above those results <eos>
 among those companies expected to have a down quarter are hewlett-packard co. <unk> corp. and sun microsystems inc. generally solid performers in the past <eos>
 international business machines corp. also is expected to report disappointing results <eos>
 apple computer inc. meanwhile is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended <unk> <eos>
 another <unk> message comes from businessland inc. a computer retailer <eos>
 in july the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from apple and ibm had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended june N to $ N million or N cents a share <eos>
 this month however businessland warned investors that results for its first quarter ended sept. N had n't met expectations <eos>
 the company said it expects earnings of N to N cents a share down from N cents a share in the year-earlier period <eos>
 while the earnings picture <unk> observers say the major forces expected to shape the industry in the coming year are <unk> <eos>
 companies will continue to war over standards <eos>
 in computer publishing a battle over <unk> is hurting adobe systems inc. which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays <eos>
 until recently adobe had a lock on the market for image software but last month apple adobe 's biggest customer and microsoft <unk> <eos>
 now the two firms are <unk> on an alternative to adobe 's approach and analysts say they are likely to carry ibm the biggest seller of personal computers along with them <eos>
 the short-term outlook for adobe 's business however appears strong <eos>
 the company is beginning to ship a new software program that 's being <unk> as a <unk> for owners of <unk> printers sold by apple <eos>
 the program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material <eos>
 john <unk> adobe 's chief executive officer said the mountain view calif. company has been receiving N calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference several weeks ago <eos>
 meanwhile competition between various operating systems which control the basic functions of a computer <unk> trouble for software firms generally <eos>
 it creates uncertainty and usually <unk> down sales said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> financial group <eos>
 mr. <unk> said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of <unk> corp. maker of a widely used computer publishing program <eos>
 he expects <unk> to report earnings of N cents a share on revenues of $ N million for its third quarter compared with earnings of N cents a share on revenue of N million in the year-earlier period <eos>
 <unk> officials could n't be reached for comment <eos>
 on the other hand the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant <eos>
 a bus is the data highway within a computer <eos>
 ibm is backing one type of bus called <unk> while the nine other leading computer makers including <unk> and compaq computer corp. have chosen another method <eos>
 users do n't care about the bus said daniel benton an analyst at goldman sachs & co <eos>
 he said apple 's family of <unk> computers for instance uses four different buses and no one seems to mind <eos>
 the gap between winners and <unk> will grow <eos>
 in personal computers apple compaq and ibm are expected to tighten their hold on their business <eos>
 at the same time <unk> firms will continue to lose ground <eos>
 some lagging competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether <eos>
 <unk> technology for instance is considered a candidate to sell its troubled operation <eos>
 <unk> has done well establishing a distribution business but they have n't delivered products that sell said <unk> brown an analyst at prudential-bache securities <eos>
 mr. brown estimates <unk> whose terminals business is strong will report a loss of N cents a share for its quarter ended <unk> <eos>
 personal-computer makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms <eos>
 <unk> powerful <unk> computers designed with one or more microprocessors as their brains are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes <eos>
 the guys that make traditional hardware are really being <unk> by <unk> machines said mr. benton <eos>
 as a result of this trend longtime <unk> <unk> ibm and digital equipment corp. are scrambling to <unk> with <unk> systems of their own <eos>
 but they will have to act quickly <eos>
 mr. benton expects compaq to unveil a family of high-end personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of <unk> machines <eos>
 a <unk> of new computer companies also has targeted this <unk> market <eos>
 population drain ends for midwestern states <eos>
 iowa is making a comeback <eos>
 so are indiana ohio and michigan <eos>
 the population of all four states is on the <unk> according to new census bureau estimates following declines throughout the early 1980s <eos>
 the gains to be sure are rather small <eos>
 iowa for instance saw its population grow by N people or N N between N and N the census bureau says <eos>
 still even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since N <eos>
 between N and N north <unk> was the only state in the midwest to lose population a loss of N people <eos>
 six of the N midwestern states have been growing steadily since N illinois kansas minnesota missouri south <unk> and wisconsin <eos>
 the northeast has been holding its own in the population race <eos>
 seven of nine states have grown each year since N including new york which lost N N of its population during the 1970s <eos>
 and although pennsylvania and massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade they are growing again <eos>
 at the same time several states in the south and west have had their own population turnaround <eos>
 seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population west virginia mississippi louisiana oklahoma <unk> wyoming and alaska <eos>
 overall though the south and west still <unk> the northeast and midwest and fast-growing states like florida and california ensure that the pattern will continue <eos>
 but the growth gap between the sun belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing <eos>
 more elderly maintain their independence <eos>
 thanks to modern medicine more couples are growing old together <eos>
 and even after losing a spouse more of the elderly are staying independent <eos>
 a new census bureau study of the <unk> population shows that N N of people aged N to N were living with a spouse in N up from N N in N <eos>
 this does n't mean they 're less likely to live alone however <eos>
 that share has remained at about N N since N <eos>
 what has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other <unk> such as children <eos>
 in N N N of those aged N to N lived with <unk> other than spouses down from N N in N <eos>
 as people get even older many become <unk> <eos>
 but even among those aged N and older the share living with a spouse rose slightly to N N in N from N N in N <eos>
 like their younger counterparts the older elderly are less likely to live with other <unk> <eos>
 only N N of those aged N and older lived with <unk> other than spouses in N down from N N in N <eos>
 the likelihood of living alone beyond the age of N has increased to N N from N N <eos>
 more people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off <unk> and financially <eos>
 careers count most for the <unk> <eos>
 many affluent people place personal success and money above family <eos>
 at least that 's what a survey by ernst & young and <unk> <unk> <unk> indicates <eos>
 two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families <eos>
 being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group <eos>
 unlike most studies of the affluent market this survey excluded the <unk> <eos>
 average household income for the sample was $ N and average net assets were reported as $ N <eos>
 the goal was to learn about one of today 's fastest-growing income groups the <unk> class <eos>
 although they represent only N N of the population they control nearly one-third of discretionary income <eos>
 across the board these consumers value quality buy what they like rather than just what they need and appreciate products that are distinctive <eos>
 despite their considerable incomes and assets N N of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure and <unk> do n't feel that they have made it <eos>
 <unk> percent do n't even feel they are financially well off <eos>
 many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves either <eos>
 about N N do n't feel they 're more able than others <eos>
 while <unk> feel some <unk> about being affluent only N N give $ N or more to charity each year <eos>
 <unk> percent attend <unk> services regularly at the same time N N feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one 's principles <eos>
 odds and ends <eos>
 the number of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation 's largest banks has more than doubled since N <eos>
 the american bankers association says that women make up N N of officials and managers in the top N banks up from N N in N <eos>
 the share of minorities in those positions has risen to N N from N N <eos>
 <unk> personal income in the u.s. grew faster than inflation last year according to the bureau of economic analysis <eos>
 the amount of income <unk> up for each man woman and child was $ N in N up N N from $ N in N <eos>
 per capita personal income ranged from $ N in mississippi to $ N in connecticut <eos>
 there are N million students in college this fall up N N from N the national center for education statistics estimates <eos>
 about N N are women and N N are <unk> students <eos>
 this small dallas suburb 's got trouble <eos>
 trouble with a capital <unk> and that <unk> with <unk> and that stands for pool <eos>
 more than N years ago prof. harold hill the con man in meredith <unk> 's the music man warned the citizens of river city iowa against the game <eos>
 now <unk> spirits on <unk> 's town council have barred the town 's <unk> hotel the grand <unk> from <unk> three free pool tables in its new <unk> <eos>
 mayor lynn <unk> and two members of the council said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along <unk> 's main street <eos>
 and the mayor in an <unk> that bears a <unk> <unk> to prof. hill 's warned that alcohol leads to betting which leads to fights <eos>
 the council 's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been <unk> <unk> for years <eos>
 obviously they 're not in touch with what 's going on says tom <unk> vice president of the national <unk> <unk> association <eos>
 pool is hot in new york and chicago he insists where upscale <unk> places are adding tables <eos>
 with today 's tougher drunk driving laws he adds people do n't want to just sit around and drink <eos>
 besides <unk> behavior seems unlikely at the grand <unk> where rooms average $ N a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for $ N a pop <eos>
 at the <unk> manager elizabeth <unk> wo n't admit <unk> in jeans <unk> or tennis shoes <eos>
 but a majority of the <unk> council did n't buy those arguments <eos>
 introducing pool argued <unk> <unk> <unk> would be dangerous <eos>
 it would open a can of <unk> <eos>
 <unk> is no <unk> to cans of <unk> either <eos>
 after its previous mayor committed <unk> last year an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town 's <unk> for trips and <unk> <eos>
 the <unk> embarrassed town officials although they argued that the problems were n't as severe as the media suggested <eos>
 now comes the pool <unk> <eos>
 i think there 's some people worried about something pretty ridiculous <unk> john <unk> says <eos>
 i thought this was all taken care of in the music man <eos>
 the only thing robert goldberg could <unk> about cbs 's new show island son leisure & arts sept. N was the local color unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their <unk> <eos>
 for instance <unk> white is not the ultimate <unk> <unk> <unk> is <eos>
 richard <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> and rolling up its long <unk> <eos>
 and the local expression for brother is <unk> not <unk> <eos>
 and even if a <unk> would wear flowers in her hair while on duty if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left not right <unk> <eos>
 sorry the show does not even have the one <unk> quality of genuine local color <eos>

 of all the ethnic <unk> in america which is the most troublesome right now <eos>
 a good bet would be the tension between blacks and <unk> in new york city <eos>
 or so it must seem to <unk> mason the veteran jewish <unk> appearing in a new abc <unk> airing on tuesday nights N p.m. edt <eos>
 not only is mr. mason the star of chicken soup he 's also the <unk> of a <unk> tradition dating back to duck soup and he 's currently a man in hot water <eos>
 here in neutral language is the <unk> of mr. mason 's remarks quoted first in the village voice while he was a paid spokesman for the rudolph giuliani mayoral campaign and then in newsweek after he and the campaign <unk> company <eos>
 mr. mason said that many jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks so they support black candidates <unk> <eos>
 he said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination so they too support black candidates <unk> <eos>
 he said that <unk> have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice <unk> <eos>
 of course mr. mason did not use neutral language <eos>
 as a <unk> of ethnic humor from the old days on the <unk> belt live television and the <unk> circuit mr. mason <unk> reached for the <unk> <eos>
 he said <unk> were sick with <unk> and he called david dinkins mr. giuliani 's black opponent a fancy <unk> with a <unk> <eos>
 if mr. mason had used less <unk> language to <unk> his <unk> analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow new <unk> would the water be quite so hot <eos>
 it probably would because few or none of the people upset by mr. mason 's remarks have bothered to <unk> between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used <unk> language <eos>
 in addition some of mr. mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of <unk> <eos>
 for example the new york state counsel for the <unk> said that mr. mason is like a <unk> <eos>
 people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck <eos>
 these critics fail to <unk> between the type of ethnic humor that aims at <unk> another group such as polish jokes and the type that is <unk> aiming <unk> as well as <unk> <eos>
 the latter typically is the humor of the <unk> and it was <unk> by both blacks and <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> stage as a means of <unk> their white and <unk> audiences along with themselves <eos>
 in the hands of a <unk> like <unk> bruce this <unk> <unk> could cut both the <unk> and the audience to <unk> <eos>
 but <unk> by a pro like <unk> mason it is a <unk> form of <unk> <eos>
 why <unk> <eos>
 because despite all the media <unk> about comedy and politics not <unk> they are similar in one respect both can serve as <unk> for easing <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of groups in conflict <eos>
 that 's why it 's dangerous to have <unk> thought police on college <unk> and elsewhere <unk> all critical mention of group differences <eos>
 as elizabeth <unk> wrote in the new york times just before the mason <unk> perhaps <unk> would not <unk> over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to <unk> <eos>
 the question is if group conflicts still exist as <unk> they do and if mr. mason 's type of ethnic humor is <unk> then what other means do we have for letting off steam <eos>
 do n't say the tv <unk> because that happens to be a <unk> that in its desperate need to attract everybody and <unk> nobody resembles politics more than it does comedy <eos>
 it is true that the best <unk> do allow group differences to <unk> <unk> vs. blue-collar <unk> in <unk> children vs. adults in the cosby show <eos>
 but these are not the differences that make <unk> <eos>
 in chicken soup mr. mason plays <unk> a jewish <unk> <unk> <unk> lynn <unk> an irish widow and mother of three against the wishes of his mother <unk> <unk> and her brother michael <unk> <unk> <eos>
 it 's worth noting that both <unk> <unk> are <unk> <eos>
 at least they both speak with strong <unk> as do <unk> and <unk> <eos>
 it could n't be more obvious that chicken soup is being made from an old <unk> <eos>
 and a safe one imagine if the <unk> in question were between an orthodox <unk> and a member of the nation of <unk> <eos>
 back in the 1920s the play and movie versions of <unk> 's irish rose made the theme of <unk> between the <unk> <unk> of jewish and irish <unk> so popular that its author anne <unk> lost a <unk> suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public <unk> <eos>
 and it has remained there as <unk> by its <unk> in a N cbs <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> whose sole <unk> was that it led to the <unk> marriage of meredith <unk> and david <unk> <eos>
 clearly the question with chicken soup is not whether the pot will <unk> over but whether it will <unk> at all <eos>
 so far the <unk> have been few and far between <eos>
 part of the problem is the tendency of all <unk> ever since the <unk> days of norman <unk> to <unk> about social issues <eos>
 to some extent this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to <unk> us about ethnic <unk> by <unk> them <eos>
 for instance michael <unk> <unk> not because he 's a <unk> jewish businessman but because he <unk> his <unk> job as a salesman in order to become a social worker <eos>
 even more <unk> is the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and mr. mason 's comic <unk> <eos>
 the best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end and occasionally in the middle when mr. mason <unk> into his <unk> mode and starts <unk> out that old-fashioned jewish <unk> to other people as well as to himself <eos>
 but too often these <unk> lack spark because this <unk> like all <unk> is <unk> about <unk> mr. mason 's stock in trade ethnic differences <eos>
 i 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the <unk> dispute over the <unk> <unk> at <unk> <eos>
 that issue like racial <unk> in new york city will have to cool down not heat up before it can <unk> <eos>
 but i am suggesting that they stop requiring mr. mason to <unk> his classic <unk> with some line about <unk> for other people that would sound <unk> on the <unk> of miss america <eos>
 at your age <unk> you ought to know that you ca n't make soup without turning up the <unk> <eos>
 the official white house reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a <unk> history of calm right up through friday <eos>
 treasury secretary nicholas brady said in a statement friday that the stock-market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy <eos>

 sound familiar <eos>
 here 's what ronald reagan said after the N crash the underlying economy remains sound <eos>
 there is nothing wrong with the economy all the <unk> are up <eos>

 the senate 's decision to approve a <unk> deficit-reduction bill without a capital-gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of <unk> a gains tax reduction this year <eos>
 late friday night the senate voted N to approve an estimated $ N billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened rather than narrowed the federal budget deficit <eos>
 lawmakers drastically <unk> the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases <eos>
 we 're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill said senate budget committee chairman james <unk> d. <unk> <eos>
 but senate supporters of the <unk> legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside including a capital-gains tax cut <eos>
 in addition the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the house includes a capital-gains provision <eos>
 house-senate negotiations are likely to begin at <unk> and last for a while <eos>
 no one can predict exactly what will happen on the house side said senate minority leader robert dole r. <unk> <eos>
 but he added i believe republicans and democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this year <eos>
 white house budget director richard darman told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill <eos>
 we do n't need this as a way to get capital gains he said <eos>
 house budget committee chairman leon <unk> d. calif said in an interview if that 's the signal that comes from the white house that will help a great deal <eos>
 the senate 's decision was a setback for president bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year <eos>
 opponents of the cut are playing <unk> <eos>
 senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said he was confident that any house-senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut <eos>
 and a senior aide to the house ways and means committee where tax legislation <unk> said there are n't any plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year <eos>
 one obvious place to <unk> a capital-gains tax cut and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit <eos>
 such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month <eos>
 the senate bill was <unk> back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through congress <eos>
 because the legislation has n't been completed president bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the gramm-rudman deficit-reduction law <eos>
 senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the house to agree to the <unk> bill <eos>
 the house appears reluctant to join the senators <eos>
 a key is whether house republicans are willing to <unk> to their senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions <eos>
 although i am encouraged by the senate action said chairman dan <unk> d. ill of the house ways and means committee it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the <unk> conference with the senate <eos>
 another big question <unk> over the debate is what president bush thinks <eos>
 he has been <unk> a <unk> bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut <eos>
 but republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and <unk> the N votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor so they went ahead with the <unk> bill <eos>
 the senate bill was stripped of many popular though <unk> provisions a number of which are included in the house-passed bill <eos>
 these include a child-care initiative and <unk> of <unk> tax breaks for low-income housing and <unk> expenditures <eos>
 also missing from the senate bill is the house 's repeal of a law called section N that <unk> companies to give <unk> workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives <eos>
 one <unk> provision that was originally in the senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by chairman lloyd <unk> d. texas of the senate finance committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts <eos>
 mr. <unk> said he hopes the senate will consider that measure soon <eos>
 to the <unk> of some doctors the bill dropped a plan passed by the finance committee that would have <unk> the entire <unk> system under medicare <eos>
 to the <unk> of many low-income people efforts to boost medicaid funding especially in rural areas also were <unk> <eos>
 asked why senators were giving up so much new mexico sen. pete <unk> the ranking republican on the senate budget committee said we 're looking like <unk> <eos>
 things had just gone too far <eos>
 sen. dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator <eos>
 it worked others said because there were no exceptions all <unk> provisions were <unk> <eos>
 the senate also dropped a plan by its finance committee that would have increased the income <unk> beyond which senior citizens have their social security benefits reduced <eos>
 in addition the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a N N <unk> tax on long-distance telephone calls <eos>
 it no longer includes a plan that would have <unk> what remains of the <unk> method of accounting which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden <eos>
 it also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current <unk> <eos>
 also <unk> was a <unk> increase in the maximum <unk> safety and health administration penalties which would have raised $ N million in fiscal N <eos>
 a provision that would have made the social security administration an independent agency was <unk> <eos>
 the approval of the senate bill was especially sweet for sen. mitchell who had proposed the streamlining <eos>
 mr. mitchell 's relations with budget director darman who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure have been <unk> since mr. darman chose to <unk> the maine democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal N supplemental spending bill <eos>
 the deficit reduction bill contains $ N billion in tax increases in fiscal N and $ N billion over five years <eos>
 the <unk> provisions which affect mostly corporations would <eos>
 prevent companies that have made leveraged buy-outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy-outs effective aug. N N <eos>
 require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather than received effective the day after the tax bill is enacted <eos>

 the plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees next year <eos>

 the statistics quoted by the new census bureau report <unk> from N to N are out of date certainly as an average for the northeast and possibly for the rest of the country <eos>
 i think what bothered me most about the piece was that there seemed to be an underlying attitude to tell your readers all is well if you 're getting laid off do n't worry and if you 're <unk> it 's a seller 's market <eos>
 to top it off you <unk> the <unk> showing the average number of months in a job search as time off <eos>

 just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks wall street suffered another severe attack of nerves <eos>
 does this signal another black monday is coming <eos>
 or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity just like oct. N N eventually turned out to be <eos>
 here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about friday 's action what happens next and what investors should do <eos>
 joseph <unk> <eos>
 i 'm the only one who said there would be an october massacre all through late august and september says mr. <unk> once a widely followed market <unk> and still a well-known newsletter writer <eos>
 everyone will tell you that this time is different from N he says <eos>
 well in some ways it is different but technically it is just the same <eos>
 if you 're a <unk> you <unk> the signals <eos>
 right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out <eos>
 i see no major support until N <eos>
 i see a possibility of going to N this month <eos>
 mr. <unk> says he would n't even think of buying until at least N to N stocks have hit 52-week lows about N stocks hit new lows friday <eos>
 most people he says have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like <eos>
 <unk> <unk> <eos>
 a <unk> analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc. ms. <unk> had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the N crash <eos>
 friday 's big drop she says was not a crash <eos>
 this was an october massacre like those that occurred in N and N <eos>
 now as in those two years her stock market indicators are positive <eos>
 so she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained <eos>
 those <unk> lasted one to four weeks and took the market N N down she says <eos>
 this is exactly the same thing as far as i 'm concerned <eos>
 thus she says if the dow jones industrial average dropped below N it would just be a <unk> <eos>
 my advice is to buy <eos>
 as she <unk> it the average stock now sells for about N times companies ' earnings <eos>
 she says that ratio could climb to N given current interest rates and still be within the range of fair value <eos>
 <unk> davis <eos>
 friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market says mr. davis president of <unk> davis research inc <eos>
 but mr. davis whose views are widely respected by money managers says he expects no <unk> crash <eos>
 there was a unique combination in N he says <eos>
 margin debt was at a record high <eos>
 there was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds <eos>
 the main thing was portfolio insurance a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses <eos>
 a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject to it <eos>
 in N such selling contributed to a <unk> effect <eos>
 today could even be an up day mr. davis says if major brokerage firms agree to <unk> from program trading <eos>
 over the next several months though he says things look bad <eos>
 i think the market will be heading down into november he says <eos>
 we will probably have a year-end rally and then go down again <eos>
 sort of a <unk> bear market <eos>
 he expects the downturn to carry the dow jones industrial average down to around N sometime next year <eos>
 that would be a normal bear market he says <eos>
 i guess that 's my forecast <eos>
 leon g. <unk> <eos>
 i do n't think the market is going through another october <unk> <eos>
 i do n't think that 's the case at all says mr. <unk> a partner at goldman sachs & co. and chairman of goldman sachs asset management <eos>
 mr. <unk> sees this as a good time to pick up bargains but he does n't think there 's any need to rush <eos>
 i expect the market to open weaker monday but then it should find some stability <eos>
 he <unk> off several major differences between now and two years ago <eos>
 unlike N interest rates have been falling this year <eos>
 unlike N the dollar has been strong <eos>
 and unlike N the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of <unk> <eos>
 but the economy 's slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits is n't good he says <eos>
 so it 's a very mixed bag <eos>
 thus he concludes this is not a good environment to be fully invested in stocks <eos>
 if i had come into friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios i would not do any buying <eos>
 but we came into friday with a conservative portfolio so i would look to do some modest buying on behalf of clients <eos>
 we 're going to look for some of the <unk> companies that got <unk> friday <eos>
 john kenneth <unk> <eos>
 this is the latest <unk> of the capacity of the financial community for <unk> <unk> says mr. <unk> an economist <eos>
 i see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion he says <eos>
 the explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has <unk> a lot of <unk> securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the <unk> of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity <eos>
 this has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable <eos>
 nevertheless he says a depression does n't appear likely <eos>
 there is more <unk> in the economy at large than we commonly <unk> he says <eos>
 it takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the <unk> much as the financial community and the government may try <eos>
 mario <unk> <eos>
 new york money manager mario <unk> an expert at <unk> takeover candidates says that takeovers are n't totally gone <eos>
 companies are still going to buy companies around the world he says <eos>
 examples are ford looking at jaguar bellsouth looking at lin broadcasting <eos>
 these sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them so mr. <unk> figures they will continue <eos>
 the market was up N N since president bush took office mr. <unk> says so a correction was to be expected <eos>
 he thinks another crash is unlikely and says he was <unk> at selected stocks during friday 's plunge <eos>
 stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity this week for guys like me he says <eos>
 jim rogers <eos>
 it seems to me that this is the <unk> that has finally <unk> the balloon says mr. rogers a professor of finance at columbia university and former <unk> of one of the most successful hedge funds in history quantum fund <eos>
 he sees economic problems financial problems ahead for the u.s. with a fairly strong possibility of a recession <eos>
 friday you could n't sell dollars he says <eos>
 dealers would give you a quote but then refuse to make the trade <eos>
 if the dollar stays weak he says that will add to <unk> pressures in the u.s. and make it hard for the federal reserve board to ease interest rates very much <eos>
 mr. rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the london and tokyo markets go <eos>
 he recommends that investors sell <unk> stocks but hang on to some other stocks especially utilities which often do well during periods of economic weakness <eos>
 frank <unk> <eos>
 many people now claim to have predicted the N crash <eos>
 <unk> newsletter writer francis <unk> <unk> actually did it he stated in writing in september N that the dow jones industrial average was likely to decline about N points the following month <eos>
 mr. <unk> says what happens now will depend a good deal on the federal reserve board <eos>
 if it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks he says that could quiet things down <eos>
 if not we could go to N very soon <eos>
 frank w. <unk> <eos>
 stock prices would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks says mr. <unk> president and managing director of renaissance investment management inc. in cincinnati <eos>
 renaissance which manages about $ N billion drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally <eos>
 renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents primarily u.s. treasury bills <eos>
 <unk> probably are the right place to be he says <eos>
 regarding the oct. N letter to the editor from rep. tom <unk> chairman of the house subcommittee on employment and housing alleging <eos>
 N that your sept. N editorial <unk> committees was <unk> inaccurate and deliberately misleading <eos>
 i thought your editorial was <unk> accurate and deliberately <unk> <eos>
 N that mr. <unk> supported the rights of the witnesses to take the fifth amendment <eos>
 yes he did <eos>
 as i watched him on <unk> i heard him speak those lovely words about the bill of rights which he quotes from the <unk> of the hearings <eos>
 he did repeat those nice <unk> several times as an indication of his support for the constitution <eos>
 he used about N words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights <eos>
 unfortunately by my rough guess he used better than N words <unk> <unk> on the witnesses for exercising the fifth <eos>
 he <unk> his <unk> of constitutional meat between large <unk> of <unk> commentary <eos>
 as your editorial <unk> pointed out samuel <unk> former hud secretary and <unk> wilson mr. <unk> 's former aide are currently being held up to <unk> for taking the fifth amendment <eos>
 that certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by mr. <unk> <eos>
 N that his committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at hud <eos>
 my colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court etc <eos>
 <unk> <unk> <eos>
 by any reasonable man <unk> mr. <unk> and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted <eos>
 apparently their verdict is in <eos>
 right now they 're pursuing evidence <eos>
 that 's not a bad way to proceed just somewhat different from standard american practice <eos>
 how was that practice referred to when i was in school <eos>
 <unk> yes something called a star chamber <eos>
 of course mr. <unk> <unk> protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change <eos>
 no doubt that 's partially true <eos>
 everything that mr. <unk> says in his letter is partially true <eos>
 he 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hud officials <eos>
 but if his explanation of <unk> is true why is his investigation so <unk> as to identify criminal activity <eos>
 why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and <unk> <eos>
 such as what happened when congress wanted to know about $ N toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost <eos>
 no mr. <unk> 's complaints simply wo n't wash <eos>
 N that the journal <unk> the <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and abuse of the public that took place while mr. <unk> was secretary of hud etc. and so forth <eos>
 no to my mind the journal did not defend <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and abuse of the public trust <eos>
 it defended appropriate constitutional <unk> and practical common sense <eos>
 the problem which the journal so <unk> pointed out in a number of articles is not the likes of mr. <unk> who after all is really a bit player on the stage but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a <unk> body <eos>
 of course we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective <eos>
 the system is the problem not an individual member <eos>
 individuals can always have their hands <unk> <eos>
 it 's when such <unk> does n't occur that we 've got trouble <eos>
 i do not by any means defend hud management <eos>
 but i think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to american <unk> of liberty and freedom than any <unk> and yes maybe <unk> within hud could possibly generate <eos>
 the last time i saw a similar congressional hearing was when <unk> <unk> joe <unk> did his work <eos>
 raymond <unk> <eos>
 <unk> n.j <eos>
 i disagree with the statement by mr. <unk> that one should not draw an adverse <unk> against former hud officials who <unk> their fifth amendment privilege against <unk> in congressional hearings <eos>
 the fifth amendment states in relevant part that no person shall be <unk> in any criminal case to be a witness against himself <eos>
 this privilege against <unk> <unk> the drawing of an adverse <unk> against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify <eos>
 thus in a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be <unk> to take the stand as a witness thus forcing him to take the fifth <eos>
 the privilege however has been limited in <unk> with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only <eos>
 the supreme court and some states have specifically recognized that the fifth amendment does not preclude the <unk> where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause <eos>
 <unk> v. <unk> N u.s. N N <eos>
 thus in a civil case a defendant may be called as a witness he may be forced to testify or take the fifth and his taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse <unk> against him in the civil matter <eos>
 he may take the fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and <unk> belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution <eos>
 allowing the defendant to take the fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony <unk> him in the civil matter but because the testimony in the civil matter could be <unk> used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution <eos>
 <unk> the risk of such prosecution a court may order the defendant to testify <eos>
 thus when mr. <unk> asserted the fifth in a <unk> proceeding particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel one must conclude that he held a <unk> <unk> belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution <eos>
 the subcommittee congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse <unk> and to <unk> with mr. <unk> 's own belief that his testimony could help <unk> him of a crime <eos>
 drawing the adverse <unk> in a <unk> congressional hearing does not <unk> the fifth amendment shield against <unk> <eos>

 it was friday the 13th and the stock market plummeted nearly N points <eos>
 just a <unk> <eos>
 or is <unk> fear of the number N justified <eos>
 in <unk> a so-called friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors <eos>
 robert <unk> and <unk> <unk> professors of finance at the university of miami found evidence that the market is spooked by friday the 13th <eos>
 but their study which <unk> the N period has since been shown to be <unk> by an <unk> choice of data <eos>
 in the <unk> the market took falls nine times in a row on friday the <unk> <eos>
 but the date tends to be a plus not a minus for stocks according to yale <unk> a <unk> of stock market <unk> <eos>
 another study found that the N <unk> the 13th in the N period had higher than average returns higher even than <unk> in general which tend to be strong days for stock prices <eos>
 on the only other friday the 13th this year the dow jones industrial average rose about four points <eos>
 professor <unk> says the original study titled friday the 13th part <unk> was published <unk> <eos>
 in a similar <unk> he adds that the anniversary of the N crash and saturday 's full moon could have played a part too in friday 's market activity <eos>
 <unk> of those during the N crash that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity <unk> some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went <unk> <eos>
 we could n't get dealers to answer their phones said robert king senior vice president of otc trading at <unk> co. in atlanta <eos>
 it was like the friday before black monday two years ago <eos>
 whether <unk> phone calls had any effect or not nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the new york and american exchanges <eos>
 nonetheless the nasdaq composite index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever <unk> N or N N to N <eos>
 ten points of the drop occurred during the last N minutes of trading <eos>
 by comparison the new york stock exchange composite tumbled N N friday and the american stock exchange composite fell N N <eos>
 on oct. N N the nasdaq composite fell N points or N N followed by its devastating <unk> or N N slide three days later <eos>
 nasdaq volume friday totaled N million shares which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year <eos>
 the <unk> record of N million shares was set on oct. N <eos>
 there was n't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved said <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> a new york company that makes markets in thousands of otc issues <eos>
 most of the complaints about <unk> phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors <eos>
 mr. king of <unk> and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls rather than a <unk> attempt to avoid making trades <eos>
 the subject is a <unk> one for nasdaq and its <unk> companies which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash <eos>
 peter dapuzzo head of retail equity trading at shearson lehman hutton declared it was the last hour of trading on a friday <eos>
 there were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots <eos>
 it was n't <unk> we were all busy <eos>
 james <unk> head of otc trading at hambrecht & quist in san francisco said it was just like two years ago <eos>
 everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time <eos>
 <unk> mullins the otc trading chief at dean witter reynolds in new york said <unk> that his company executed every order it received by the close of trading <eos>
 but he added you can only take one call at a time <eos>
 market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur <eos>
 on days like friday that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to <eos>
 when selling is so <unk> prices fall <unk> and fast <eos>
 two years ago faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories market makers themselves began <unk> shares <unk> the slide in otc stock prices <eos>
 on friday some market makers were selling again traders said <eos>
 but with profits sagging on wall street since the crash companies have kept smaller share <unk> on hand <eos>
 mr. <unk> of hambrecht & quist said some prices fell without trades taking place as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares <eos>
 everyone was hitting everyone else 's bid he said <eos>
 so while otc companies incurred losses on friday trading officials said the damage was n't as bad as it was in N <eos>
 two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big <unk> <eos>
 i do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now said mr. king of <unk> <eos>
 tony <unk> head of equity trading at <unk> <unk> & <unk> in minneapolis said that <unk> <unk> actually made money on friday <eos>
 it helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago he said <eos>
 joseph <unk> president of the national association of securities dealers which oversees the nasdaq computerized trading system said that despite the rush of selling he never considered the situation an emergency <eos>
 the pace of trading was orderly he said <eos>
 nasdaq 's small order execution system worked <unk> as did the automated system for larger trades according to mr. <unk> <eos>
 nevertheless the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors ' confidence <eos>
 in the past the otc market <unk> on a firm base of <unk> participation <eos>
 because nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to <unk> levels traders and otc market officials hope the damage wo n't be permanent <eos>
 but they are worried <eos>
 we were just starting to get the public 's confidence back <unk> mr. mullins of dean witter <eos>
 more troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently erode the base of <unk> support the otc market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the october N crash <eos>
 mr. <unk> of <unk> <unk> says some action from government policy makers would <unk> investor fears <eos>
 it wo n't take much more to scare the hell out of retail investors he says <eos>
 the sellers on friday came from all corners of the otc market big and small institutional investors as well as individual investors and market makers <eos>
 but <unk> traders said the sell orders generally ranged from N shares to N shares compared with blocks of N shares or more two years ago <eos>
 shearson 's mr. dapuzzo said retail investors nervously sold stock friday and never returned to <unk> <eos>
 institutional investors which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in <unk> gains made through the third quarter were <unk> <eos>
 we had a good amount of selling from institutions but not as much panic mr. dapuzzo said <eos>
 if they could n't sell some of them put the shares back on the shelf <eos>
 in addition he said some bigger institutional investors placed bids to buy some otc stocks whose prices were beaten down <eos>
 in addition mr. dapuzzo said computer-guided program selling of otc stocks in the russell index of N small stocks and the standard & poor 's 500-stock index sent <unk> waves through the market <eos>
 nasdaq 's biggest stocks were <unk> <eos>
 the nasdaq N index of the largest <unk> issues including the big otc technology issues tumbled N N or N to N <eos>
 the nasdaq financial index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped N N or N to N <eos>
 the otc market has only a handful of <unk> stocks <eos>
 but they fell sharply <eos>
 mccaw cellular communications for instance has offered to buy lin broadcasting as well as metromedia 's new york city cellular telephone interests and in a separate transaction sell certain mccaw properties to contel cellular <eos>
 mccaw lost N N or N N to N <eos>

 pension funds insurers and other <unk> of the investing world said they began <unk> up stocks during friday 's market rout <eos>
 and they plan to buy more today <eos>
 <unk> or <unk> many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the october N crash buying at the bottom pays off <eos>
 to be sure big investors might put away their <unk> in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today <eos>
 they could still panic and bail out of the market <eos>
 but their N performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse <eos>
 last time we got <unk> for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst said john w. rogers president of chicago-based <unk> capital management inc. which manages $ N billion of stocks <eos>
 mr. rogers spent half his cash on hand friday for our favorite stocks that have fallen apart <eos>
 he expects to invest the rest if the market <unk> further <eos>
 <unk> portfolio manager james craig was n't <unk> when friday 's rout <unk> $ N million from the value of the $ N million <unk> fund he oversees <eos>
 i waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through he said <eos>
 then he jumped into the market <eos>
 i spent $ N million in the last half-hour <eos>
 other money managers also opened their <unk> <eos>
 i was buying at the close friday and i 'll be buying again because i know we 're getting good value said frederick a. <unk> president of <unk> asset management inc. greenwich conn <eos>
 there is no <unk> on the fundamental level for this crash <eos>
 unlike mutual funds which can be forced to sell <unk> when investors rush to withdraw money big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market <unk> without <unk> stock <eos>
 most often they do just that because stocks have proved to be the <unk> long-term investment attracting about $ N trillion from pension funds alone <eos>
 if you bought after the crash you did very very well off the bottom said stephen b. <unk> chief investment officer of chicago-based kemper financial services inc <eos>
 the $ N billion california public employees retirement system for one added $ N billion to its stock portfolio two years ago <eos>
 the last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders and that they ca n't react to short-term events good or bad said stephen l. <unk> senior vice president for the pension consultants <unk> associates in santa <unk> calif <eos>
 those that pulled out of stocks <unk> it he said so i doubt you 'll see any significant changes in institutional portfolios as a result of friday 's decline <eos>
 stocks as measured by the standard & poor 's 500-stock index have been <unk> performers this year rising N N before friday 's plunge excluding dividends <eos>
 even friday 's slump leaves investors ahead more than N N well above the annual average for stocks over several decades <eos>
 you could go down N points and still have a good year in the market said james d. <unk> president of new york-based <unk> capital corp <eos>
 mr. <unk> however worries that the market could go down N or N points in the next few days <eos>
 it can happen before you can turn around <eos>
 he said he <unk> many parallels with N including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the <unk> of computerized program trading <eos>
 the only thing you do n't have he said is the portfolio insurance phenomenon <unk> on the rest <eos>
 most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique which is widely thought to have <unk> the N crash <eos>
 not really insurance this <unk> was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of s&p futures contracts <eos>
 in its <unk> test the $ N billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the N crash did n't work as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became <unk> <eos>
 even without portfolio insurance market conditions were grim friday money managers said <eos>
 neil <unk> whose new york-based <unk> capital partners had converted N N of its $ N million investment pool to cash in recent months said he was besieged by wall street firms friday asking him to take stock off their hands <eos>
 we got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything said mr. <unk> who happy with his returns on investments <unk> up earlier declined the offers <eos>
 mr. <unk> predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again <unk> more investors <eos>
 i think it will be a <unk> <unk> rally he said <eos>
 meanwhile friday brought a <unk> for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally <eos>
 especially <unk> were the short sellers who have been <unk> by this year 's market climb <eos>
 the <unk> sell borrowed shares hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price <eos>
 the nation 's largest <unk> operation is <unk> brothers palo alto calif. which said last may that its short positions had shown losses of N N for the year up to that point <eos>
 all that now has changed <eos>
 we 're ahead for the year because of friday said the firm 's kurt <unk> <eos>
 we 're not making a killing but we had a good day <eos>
 food and drug administration spokesman jeff <unk> said the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning <unk> pharmaceuticals inc. to the u.s. attorney 's office in baltimore <eos>
 neither <unk> nor any of the <unk> gardens n.y. company 's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes <eos>
 <unk> won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it <unk> a <unk> <unk> plc product as its own in tests <eos>
 mr. <unk> also said the fda has asked <unk> pharmaceutical co. to recall at the retail level its <unk> <unk> <unk> <eos>
 but so far the company has n't <unk> with that request the spokesman said <eos>
 <unk> the subject of a criminal investigation by the fda and the inspector general 's office of the health and human services department only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of <unk> as far down as direct customers mostly <unk> mr. <unk> said <eos>
 <unk> of <unk> n.y. earlier began a voluntary recall of both its N <unk> and N <unk> versions of the drug <eos>
 the fda has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that <unk> <unk> the <unk> product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of <unk> <eos>
 <unk> has denied that it switched the <unk> product for its own in such testing <eos>
 the west german retailer <unk> deutsche <unk> ag plans to challenge the <unk> of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the netherlands <eos>
 the eventual court decision could become a landmark in dutch corporate law because the lawsuit <unk> plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to <unk> trusts to <unk> voting power of common stockholders <eos>
 up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged though unsuccessfully <unk> 's dutch lawyers noted <eos>
 should the courts <unk> the <unk> of this type of defense <unk> will then ask the court to <unk> such a <unk> maneuver recently deployed by <unk> <unk> <unk> <eos>
 <unk> says the <unk> international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus <unk> the worth and voting power of <unk> and other shareholders <eos>
 speaking through its dutch lawyers <unk> also disclosed it holds a N N stake in <unk> <eos>
 it was previously thought <unk> held a N N stake that was accumulated since july <eos>
 a spokesman for <unk> said his company is confident of its own position and the <unk> of the <unk> issue <eos>
 he termed <unk> 's legal actions as <unk> to international cooperation among european retailers <eos>
 chase manhattan bank chairman <unk> butcher is a conservative banker and a loyal republican but on friday morning he had few kind words for president bush 's economic <unk> <eos>
 there are some very significant issues out there such as the fiscal deficit the trade deficit our relations with japan that have to be the subject of major initiatives he said in an interview <eos>
 i 'd like to see that initiative and i have n't <eos>
 there is n't a big shot an agenda <eos>
 a few hours later the stock market dropped N points <eos>
 politicians tried to finger each other for the blame although many analysts doubt that washington was <unk> responsible for wall street 's woes <eos>
 but mr. butcher 's comments make one thing clear some on wall street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy <eos>
 consider this <eos>
 by N p.m. tonight president bush must order $ N billion of automatic across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the gramm-rudman budget law <eos>
 the cuts are necessary because congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a <unk> bill <eos>
 we simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices house budget committee chairman leon <unk> d. calif said yesterday on nbc news 's meet the press <eos>
 for the last two weeks the bush administration and the federal reserve have been engaged in a <unk> battle over international economic policy <eos>
 the administration has been trying to push the dollar lower the fed has been <unk> <eos>
 one of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary <unk> between the treasury department and the federal reserve board said lawrence <unk> a bear stearns & co. economist on abc 's this week <eos>
 the administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers <eos>
 last month transportation secretary sam skinner forced northwest airlines to reduce a stake held by <unk> royal dutch airlines <eos>
 but he has since run into opposition from the treasury and the white house over that decision <eos>
 and he has kept <unk> on how his decision might affect a bid for united airlines which includes a big stake by british airways plc <eos>
 some analysts say uncertainty about washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the united airlines takeover fell through the event that triggered the market drop <eos>
 in many ways the backdrop to friday 's stock decline is <unk> similar to that of october N 's <unk> crash <eos>
 then as now the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold <eos>
 the treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy although at that time it was with west german officials rather than the federal reserve <eos>
 and concern about official actions aimed at takeovers then by the <unk> house ways and means committee rather than the transportation department were making markets nervous <eos>
 the N crash brought the reagan administration and democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ N billion even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ N billion during that period <eos>
 but barring further drops in the market this week a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year <eos>
 lawmakers and administration officials agree that friday 's drop by itself is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's <unk> plan which still is n't fully implemented <eos>
 one of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that as everyone learned in N the economy and the market can survive a one-day <unk> tumble <eos>
 everybody thought we were looking at a <unk> of N that we were looking at a recession rep. <unk> said yesterday in an interview <eos>
 that did not happen <eos>
 they learned they could survive it without much problem <eos>
 but administration officials privately agree with mr. <unk> who said a <unk> drop this week is going to force the president and congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy <eos>
 in that case there will be plenty of blame to go around <eos>
 there is an underlying concern on the part of the american people and there should be that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut said senate finance committee chairman lloyd <unk> d. texas <eos>
 nevertheless it clearly will take more than friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and white house budget director richard darman over the capital-gains fight <eos>
 hill democrats are particularly angry over mr. bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of april 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation <eos>
 there is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said yesterday on cbs news 's face the nation <eos>
 during last week 's <unk> on the <unk> bill and the capital-gains issue there were signs that senate republicans and the administration were at odds <eos>
 at the very moment that senate republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it <eos>
 when an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation oregon sen. bob packwood the ranking gop member of the <unk> senate finance committee hailed it <eos>
 asked if the administration agreed he <unk> replied the <unk> will have to speak for itself <eos>
 friday 's market tumble could spur action on <unk> the house and senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the <unk> <eos>
 senate republicans expressed the hope that the house would follow the lead of the senate which on friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal N deficit <eos>
 the market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction and the best way to do that is for the house of representatives to strip their bill of similar provisions sen. warren <unk> r. <unk> said yesterday <eos>
 the white house office of management and budget whose calculations determine whether the gramm-rudman targets are met estimated that the house-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal N <unk> by $ N billion almost half of the congressional budget office 's estimate of $ N billion <eos>
 rep. <unk> said that <unk> 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts but added we 're getting very close to the margins here <eos>
 no one in washington was willing to take the blame for <unk> friday 's drop in the stock market <eos>
 but some players were quick to seize the moment <eos>
 before the sun had set on friday richard <unk> the <unk> chief economist of the u.s. chamber of commerce issued a statement <unk> the drop in stock prices to the senate decision to postpone action on capital gains <eos>
 investors who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell were spooked he said <eos>
 there have been many <unk> reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut sen. mitchell said during his television appearance but i suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others <eos>

 small investors matched their big institutional <unk> in anxiety over the weekend but most seemed to be taking a <unk> approach and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market <eos>
 i 'm not losing faith in the market said boston lawyer christopher sullivan as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm <eos>
 but he 's not so sure about everyone else <eos>
 i think on monday the small investors are going to panic and sell predicted mr. sullivan whose investments include amr corp. 's american airlines unit and several mutual funds <eos>
 and i think institutions are going to come in and buy <eos>
 i 'm going to hold on <eos>
 if i sell now i 'll take a big loss <eos>
 some <unk> an optimism that had been <unk> when they did n't <unk> the market in N <eos>
 oh i bet it 'll be up N points on monday said <unk> <unk> a <unk> retired <unk> in lexington <unk> <eos>
 mrs. <unk> said her <unk> investment club 's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the black monday crash but no one got discouraged and we gained that back and more <eos>
 at the annual congress of the national association of investors corp. at the <unk> <unk> hotel in minneapolis the scene was calm <eos>
 some N investors representing investor clubs from around the u.s. were attending when the market started to slide friday <eos>
 but robert <unk> an official of the association said no special <unk> or emergency meetings of the investors ' clubs are planned <eos>
 in fact some of the association 's members long-term <unk> investors welcomed the drop in prices <eos>
 we hope to take advantage of it said john <unk> a member of a los angeles investors ' club <eos>
 he has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants <eos>
 not everyone is reacting so <unk> however and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of friday 's slide reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of ual corp. parent of united airlines <eos>
 marc <unk> a tampa fla. investment banker said the market drop is one of a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged <unk> era is ending <eos>
 there 's no question that there 's a general <unk> for leverage among lenders <eos>
 mr. <unk> believes however that the market could be stabilized if california investor marvin davis steps back in to the united bidding with an offer of $ N a share <eos>
 <unk> albert a <unk> dallas law student says she 's generally <unk> about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it <eos>
 i have this feeling that it 's built on sand she says that the market rises but there 's no foundation to it <eos>
 she and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the N crash although she still owns some texaco stock <eos>
 partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school i think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid <eos>
 others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand <eos>
 we all assumed october <unk> was a one-time shot said san francisco attorney david greenberg <eos>
 we told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime come on back <eos>
 now it 's happening again <eos>
 mr. greenberg got out just before the N crash and to his regret never went back even as the market soared <eos>
 this time he 's ready to buy in when the panic wears off <eos>
 still he adds we ca n't have this kind of thing happen very often <eos>
 when the little guy gets frightened the big guys hurt badly <eos>
 merrill lynch ca n't survive without the little guy <eos>
 small investors have <unk> back into the market following black monday but mostly through mutual funds <eos>
 discount brokerage customers have been in the market somewhat but not whole <unk> like they were two years ago says leslie quick jr. chairman of the quick & <unk> discount brokerage firm <eos>
 hugo <unk> senior vice president at charles <unk> corp. says schwab customers have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks <eos>
 individual investors are still angry about program trading mr. <unk> says <eos>
 <unk> <unk> a cornell university finance professor says government regulators will have to more closely control program trading to win back the confidence of the small investor <eos>
 but it 's not only the stock market that has some small investors worried <eos>
 alan <unk> general sales manager of a chrysler dealership in houston said he and his mother have some joint stock investments but the overall economy is his chief worry <eos>
 these high <unk> took a big <unk> today he said in his showroom which is within a few miles of the <unk> dollar homes of some of houston 's <unk> citizens <eos>
 and i can tell you that a high roller is n't going to come in tomorrow and buy a chrysler <unk> by <unk> <eos>
 and finally there were the <unk> <eos>
 i got out in N <eos>
 everything said <unk> <unk> an <unk> ohio plumbing contractor who was visiting chicago and stopped by fidelity investments ' <unk> street office <eos>
 i just stopped by to see how much i would have lost <eos>
 would mr. <unk> ever get back in <eos>
 are you <unk> <eos>
 when it comes to money once <unk> N times shy <eos>
 the crowded field for <unk> computers is about to become a lot more crowded <eos>
 compaq computer corp. 's long-awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market especially zenith electronics corp. the current market leader and on a <unk> of promising <unk> <eos>
 compaq 's series of <unk> <unk> a trend toward <unk> in the personal computer market <eos>
 one manufacturer already has produced a <unk> computer called a <unk> and two others have introduced even smaller <unk> <eos>
 but those machines are still considered <unk> with <unk> only a <unk> could love and screens to match <eos>
 compaq 's <unk> by contrast may be the first in their weight class not to <unk> on features found in much bigger machines <eos>
 analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market and they 're priced aggressively at $ N to $ N <eos>
 all of this comes in a machine that <unk> only six pounds and fits <unk> into most <unk> <eos>
 in recent months compaq 's competition including zenith toshiba corp. tandy corp. and nec corp. all have introduced <unk> that weigh approximately the same and that are called <unk> perhaps <unk> <eos>
 one analyst noting that most such machines are about two inches thick takes exception to the name <eos>
 this is n't quite a notebook i call it a <unk> he says <eos>
 that ca n't be said of the $ N <unk> computer introduced a few weeks ago by grid systems corp. a unit of tandy <eos>
 instead of a <unk> it features a writing surface an electronic <unk> and the ability to read block printing <eos>
 at N N pounds it may be too <unk> named but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts <unk> <eos>
 <unk> are n't far behind <eos>
 <unk> corp. 's portfolio introduced in europe two months ago and in the u.s. in early september <unk> less than a pound costs a mere $ N and runs on three <unk> <unk> yet has the power to run some <unk> and word processing programs <eos>
 some critics however say its ability to run <unk> programs is restricted by a limited memory <eos>
 <unk> computer corp. meanwhile has introduced a much more sophisticated <unk> that can run lotus N and other sophisticated software programs but costs five times as much <eos>
 at stake is what mike <unk> compaq 's president of north america operations calls the <unk> <unk> of the computer industry the search for a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere <eos>
 the market is so new nobody knows yet how big it can be <eos>
 i 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is says tom <unk> director of marketing for grid <eos>
 whether it 's $ N billion or $ N billion it does n't matter <eos>
 it 's huge <eos>
 consider the growth of <unk> which now <unk> N N of all personal computer sales <eos>
 <unk> generally anything under N pounds have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment with sales doubling this year <eos>
 responding to that demand however has led to a variety of <unk> <eos>
 making computers smaller often means <unk> memory <eos>
 it also has <unk> use of the faster more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines <eos>
 size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays <eos>
 the competitive <unk> can get pretty <unk> at times <eos>
 a <unk> spokesman for example <unk> the <unk> portfolio because it requires three <unk> while the <unk> needs only two <eos>
 both <unk> are dismissed by notebook makers who argue that they 're too small a problem <unk> also encountered in focus groups admits <unk> <unk> director of marketing <eos>
 <unk> trying to avoid the <unk> label responded with the tag line the <unk> pc a very big computer <eos>
 despite the <unk> few question the <unk> of the move to small machines that do n't make <unk> <eos>
 toward that end experts say the real battle will take place between <unk> players like toshiba zenith and now compaq <eos>
 compaq 's new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up firms like <unk> inc. which introduced in june a computer that like compaq 's uses an intel N microprocessor and has a hard disk drive <eos>
 but the <unk> product is twice as heavy and costs more than compaq 's <eos>
 compaq 's announcement also <unk> trouble for zenith which last year had N N of the u.s. laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to cie. des machines bull the french government-owned computer maker <eos>
 zenith holders will vote in december on the proposed $ N million sale a price that could slip because it is pegged to zenith 's share and sales <eos>
 compaq is already taking aim at zenith 's market share <eos>
 rod <unk> compaq 's president and chief executive officer notes <unk> that zenith 's $ N <unk> uses an <unk> <unk> <unk> disk <unk> compaq 's new machines use the more common N <unk> disk <eos>
 john p. frank president of zenith data systems simply <unk> off such criticism noting that N <unk> <unk> were also <unk> when they first replaced <unk> disks <eos>
 we do n't look at it as not being a standard we look at it as a new standard he argues <eos>
 analysts do n't see it that way <eos>
 i ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is <unk> for compaq and a <unk> for everyone else says gene <unk> president of professional marketing management inc <eos>
 adds bill <unk> senior industry analyst for <unk> a high-technology market research firm we basically think that these are very hot products <eos>
 the problem compaq is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them <eos>
 compaq 's machines include the N <unk> <unk> disk drive a <unk> screen that is only <unk> thick and an internal expansion <unk> for a <unk> in other words almost all the <unk> of a typical office machine <eos>
 others undoubtedly will follow but most analysts believe compaq has at least a six-month lead on the competition <eos>
 toshiba 's line of <unk> for example features the <unk> which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory and the <unk> which also uses a N microprocessor but which <unk> almost twice as much and is three times the size <eos>
 a third model marketed in japan may hit the u.s. by the end of the first quarter of N but by then analysts say compaq will have established itself as one of three major players <eos>
 what about big blue <eos>
 international business machines corp. analysts say has been burned twice in trying to enter the laptop market and shows no signs of trying to get into <unk> anytime soon <eos>
 honeywell inc. and international business machines corp. received air force contracts to develop integrated circuits for use in space <eos>
 honeywell 's contract totaled $ N million and ibm 's $ N million <eos>
 boeing co. received a $ N million air force contract for developing cable systems for the <unk> missile <eos>
 general dynamics corp. received a $ N million air force contract for <unk> training sets <eos>
 grumman corp. received an $ N million navy contract to upgrade aircraft electronics <eos>
 <unk> corp. received an $ N million army contract for helicopter engines <eos>
 sharp increases in the price of fresh produce caused spain 's september consumer price index to shoot up N N from the previous month pushing the annual rate of inflation to N N the national institute of statistics said friday <eos>
 the monthly increase is the highest recorded in the past four years <eos>
 the index which registered N at the end of september has a base of N set in N and is n't seasonally adjusted <eos>
 prices have risen N N in the first nine months of the year <unk> both the initial N N inflation goal set by the government of socialist prime minister <unk> gonzalez and the second revised goal of N N <eos>
 japan 's wholesale prices in september rose N N from a year earlier and were up N N from the previous month the bank of japan announced friday <eos>
 the wholesale price index stood at N compared with a N base of N <eos>
 plunge <eos>
 what plunge <eos>
 <unk> new york stock exchange issues hit 52-week highs during friday 's trading despite the dow jones industrial average 's 190.58-point plunge <eos>
 stocks of utilities held up relatively better than other market sectors during the sell-off <eos>
 and among the issues hitting new highs were detroit edison co. and <unk> <unk> power corp <eos>
 other major issues hitting highs included american telephone & telegraph co. westinghouse electric corp. exxon corp. and cigna corp. the big insurer <eos>
 of course many more issues N hit new lows <eos>
 these included international business machines corp. which during friday 's session traded below $ N a share for the first time since june N <eos>
 ibm closed at $ N down $ N <eos>
 other new lows included <unk> international corp. union carbide corp. and bethlehem steel corp. all of which are included in the industrial average <eos>
 meanwhile two initial public offerings <unk> the <unk> market in their <unk> day of national over-the-counter trading friday <eos>
 shares of rally 's inc. an operator of fast-food restaurants closed at $ N each up from its $ N offering price and shares of employee benefit plans inc. a health-care consultant closed at $ N up from its $ N offering price <eos>
 ford motor co. said it acquired N N of the shares in jaguar plc <eos>
 jaguar the london stock exchange and the u.s. securities and exchange commission are being notified of the transactions the company said <eos>
 the u.s. federal trade commission advised ford last week that it would n't raise any <unk> to the acquisition of as much as N N of jaguar shares <eos>
 the no. N auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as N N of the british luxury-car maker the maximum allowed under current united kingdom government restrictions <eos>
 general motors corp. said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with jaguar before ford began buying shares <eos>
 gm said it still is talking with jaguar about acquiring a minority interest <eos>
 investors who bought stock with borrowed money that is on margin may be more worried than most following friday 's market drop <eos>
 that 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans <eos>
 in october N these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward <unk> of the stock market <eos>
 typically a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below N N of its original value <eos>
 if the investor does n't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call the brokerage firm may begin <unk> the securities <eos>
 but some big brokerage firms said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls <eos>
 margin calls since friday have been higher than usual but reasonable a spokesman for shearson lehman hutton inc. said <eos>
 merrill lynch & co. officials do n't expect margin calls to be as big a factor as in N because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin a spokesman said <eos>
 hugo <unk> senior vice president at charles schwab corp. the san <unk> discount brokerage firm said he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for schwab customers <eos>
 he said schwab had increased margin requirements so customers have more of a cushion <eos>
 he added we learned a lesson in N about volatility <eos>
 <unk> inc. following rival hertz corp. 's lead said it is backing out of <unk> programs with three airlines <eos>
 the garden city n.y. <unk> company said it wo n't renew contracts with nwa inc. 's northwest airlines unit pan am corp. 's pan american world airways unit and <unk> airlines at the end of this year <eos>
 but it remains involved in programs with amr corp. 's american airlines unit and delta air lines <eos>
 industry estimates put <unk> 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ N million and $ N million <eos>
 a spokesman for <unk> would n't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for far less than half of the total <eos>
 budget rent a car corp. of chicago and national car rental systems inc. of minneapolis both said they had no plans to follow suit <eos>
 in fact budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs in which <unk> earn <unk> miles and <unk> can get <unk> discounts <eos>
 i can not see how this news by hertz and <unk> can not benefit budget 's programs said bob wilson budget 's vice president marketing planning <eos>
 northwest and <unk> are two of the five airlines with which budget has agreements <eos>
 national also <unk> in the northwest <unk> program along with four other airlines including delta and usair group inc. 's usair unit <eos>
 a month ago hertz of park <unk> n.j. said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with delta america west and texas air corp. 's continental airlines and eastern airlines and that <unk> with american airlines ual inc 's united airlines and usair also would be ended sometime after dec. N <eos>
 at the time hertz said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $ N million and that the value of redeemed <unk> topped $ N million <eos>
 analysts and competitors however doubt the numbers were that high <eos>
 budget said its <unk> costs are substantially below <unk> 's level <eos>
 robert d. <unk> <unk> vice president of marketing said the proliferation and costs attached to <unk> programs have significantly diminished their value <eos>
 this year has been difficult for both hertz and <unk> said charles <unk> <unk> industry analyst at alex brown & sons <eos>
 they 've been looking to get their costs down and this is a fairly <unk> way to do it he said <eos>
 cbs inc. is cutting the pat <unk> show down to one hour from its current N minutes <eos>
 cbs insisted the move was n't a setback for the program which is the network 's first entry into the <unk> talk show format since N <eos>
 i have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it said rod <unk> who was named vice president of late night entertainment in august <eos>
 this will raise the energy level of the show <eos>
 cbs will continue to program <unk> shows to follow the <unk> hour <eos>
 but cbs news will extend its <unk> <unk> by N minutes and begin at N a.m <eos>
 the show despite a promising start has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as compiled by a.c. nielsen co. finishing far below tonight on nbc a unit of general electric co. and <unk> on <unk> a unit of capital cities\/abc inc <eos>
 further <unk> the <unk> audience is the addition of the <unk> hall show syndicated by paramount communications inc <eos>
 tandem computers inc. preparing to fight with international business machines corp. for a piece of the mainframe business said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended sept. N <eos>
 tandem said it expects to report revenue of about $ N million and earnings of N cents to N cents a share <eos>
 the results which are in line with analysts ' estimates reflect a continued improvement in our u.s. business said james <unk> tandem 's chief executive officer <eos>
 in the year-earlier period tandem reported net income of $ N million or N cents a share on revenue of $ N million <eos>
 tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next week <eos>
 analysts have predicted that the cupertino calif. company will report revenue of $ N million to $ N million and earnings of N cents to N cents a share <eos>
 commenting on the results for the quarter mr. <unk> said the strength of the company 's domestic business came as a surprise to him noting that sales in every region of the u.s. exceeded our plan <eos>
 the company 's u.s. performance was helped by a record quarter for new customers he said <eos>
 tandem makes <unk> computers machines with <unk> backup systems that run stock exchanges networks of automatic <unk> and other complex computer systems <eos>
 tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers <eos>
 tandem 's new high-end computer is called <unk> <eos>
 prices for the machine which can come in various <unk> are $ N million to $ N million <eos>
 analysts expect the new computer to <unk> a hefty <unk> of business away from ibm the longtime leader in mainframes <eos>
 we believe they could <unk> perhaps two to three billion dollars from ibm over the next few years said george weiss an analyst at the gartner group <eos>
 that will spur tandem 's growth <eos>
 i 'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than N N next year said john <unk> an analyst at goldman sachs & co <eos>
 ibm is expected to respond to tandem 's <unk> by discounting its own mainframes which analysts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from tandem <eos>
 obviously ibm can give bigger discounts to users immediately said mr. weiss <eos>
 but mr. <unk> questions whether that will be enough to stop tandem 's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from big blue 's machines <eos>
 the answer is n't price reductions but new systems he said <eos>
 nevertheless tandem faces a variety of challenges the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as <unk> to ibm 's mainframes <eos>
 even mr. <unk> is reluctant to abandon this notion insisting that tandem 's new machines are n't <unk> for ibm 's mainframes <eos>
 we 're after a little bigger niche he said <eos>
 do n't jump yet <eos>
 the stock market 's <unk> may turn out to be good news for the economy <eos>
 in one wild hour of trading the market managed to accomplish what the bush administration has been trying to do unsuccessfully for weeks <eos>
 it is forcing the federal reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously <unk> dollar <eos>
 the resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could <unk> american business indeed the entire economy <eos>
 this may sound <unk> optimistic <eos>
 after all until a few years ago the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy <eos>
 when it went down by all tradition the economy followed <eos>
 that has changed partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable <eos>
 the N crash was a false alarm however you view it says university of chicago economist victor <unk> <eos>
 the market seems increasingly <unk> from the rest of the nation <eos>
 its <unk> ca n't be <unk> to fundamental business conditions nor do they appear to <unk> major shifts in the economy <eos>
 the market today has a life of its own john <unk> chairman of international business machines corp. said saturday <eos>
 there 's nothing rational about this kind of action <eos>
 of course the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week <eos>
 sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the u.s. now relies for financial <unk> <eos>
 the financial-services industry was battered by the N crash <eos>
 what 's more although the stock market is far less <unk> today than two years ago the u.s. economy is weaker <eos>
 growth is slower <eos>
 profits are softer <eos>
 debt burdens are heavier <eos>
 but if the stock market does n't continue to plummet the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate <eos>
 the fed which until friday had been <unk> moves to ease credit is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to <unk> the markets <eos>
 fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies <eos>
 but the experience of the N crash suggests the fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets <eos>
 anticipating the fed 's move money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the federal funds rate to N N late friday down from N N the day before <eos>
 tiny movements in the rate which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans are usually among the few visible tracks that the fed leaves on the monetary markets <eos>
 the dollar also began to decline friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to <unk> their desire to invest in the u.s. <eos>
 treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of <unk> with economic fundamentals threatening to <unk> the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years <eos>
 the market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the treasury was right about the <unk> dollar <eos>
 a modest drop in the dollar only a modest one mind you would be welcomed by the u.s. <eos>
 that was n't the case in N when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse producing panic among foreign investors and <unk> the flow of foreign capital to the u.s. <eos>
 another big difference between N and N is n't so <unk> <eos>
 in the third quarter of N the economy <unk> at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of N N <eos>
 the consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish N N in the third quarter of N which ended two weeks ago <eos>
 the plunge in stock prices is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down says economist lawrence <unk> of <unk> group a <unk> <unk> pa. forecasting company <eos>
 a lot of <unk> demand is gone <eos>
 consumer spending did drop in the months following black monday N but only slightly and for a short period of time recalls mr. <unk> a longtime student of business cycles <eos>
 that was offset by strength elsewhere <eos>
 the effects were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected <eos>
 today he <unk> exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink this week and if consumers <unk> in reaction <eos>
 what 's more the corporate borrowing binge has n't <unk> in the past two years <eos>
 we 've had two more years of significant accumulation of debt just at the time when earnings are being squeezed mr. <unk> notes <eos>
 the more a company relies on borrowed money the greater its <unk> to an economic slowdown <eos>
 a company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court <eos>
 the fed of course knows that very well hence its <unk> to pump credit into the economy this morning <eos>
 but in the process the fed risks <unk> inflation <eos>
 even before friday 's events harvard university economist benjamin <unk> was arguing that the fed wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets banks and highly leveraged corporations <eos>
 the biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession he reasons it 's an <unk> of <unk> inflation <eos>
 in the end the N collapse suggested the economy does n't move in <unk> with stock prices <eos>
 the economy does however depend on the confidence of businesses consumers and foreign investors <eos>
 a panic on wall street does n't exactly <unk> confidence <eos>
 surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before friday <eos>
 a 190-point drop is n't likely to make much of a <unk> <unk> that a few times over though and it will <eos>
 if the reactions of executives gathered saturday at hot springs va. for the business council meetings are typical business leaders were n't overly rattled by friday 's decline <eos>
 and if foreign investors become a <unk> more cautious well the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the u.s. can stand it <eos>
 on the bottom line the most <unk> fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before <eos>
 two years ago about the only point of comparison was the N crash and the subsequent depression <eos>
 the <unk> had a <unk> audience <eos>
 the prosperity that followed black monday permits a more optimistic view today <eos>
 at the very least the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation 's success in handling the last <unk> <eos>
 as sen. lloyd <unk> d. texas observed yesterday the fed avoided a <unk> last time <eos>
 they are more sophisticated this time <eos>
 the chemical industry is expected to report that profits eroded in the third quarter because of <unk> prices in the commodity end of the business <eos>
 producers of commodity chemicals the basic chemicals produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers <eos>
 once the chief beneficiaries of the industry 's now <unk> boom these producers also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in the N third quarter <eos>
 for some of these companies this will be the first quarter with year-to-year negative comparisons says leonard <unk> a chemical industry analyst at prudential <unk> research <eos>
 this could be the first of five or six down quarters <eos>
 perhaps most prominent dow chemical co. which as of midyear had racked up eight consecutive record quarters is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier if only by a <unk> <eos>
 though dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals the company still has a big stake in polyethylene which is used in packaging and <unk> <eos>
 analysts ' third-quarter estimates for the midland mich. company are between $ N a share and $ N a share compared with $ N a year ago when profit was $ N million on sales of $ N billion <eos>
 a dow spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimates <eos>
 at the investment firm of smith barney harris upham & co. the <unk> segment is seen pulling down overall profit for N companies representative of the whole industry by N N to N N <eos>
 you will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better says james wilbur a smith barney analyst <eos>
 first boston corp. projects that N of the N companies it follows will report lower profit <eos>
 most of the N have big <unk> operations <eos>
 still some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals <eos>
 du pont co. is thought to have had steady profit growth in white <unk> fibers and <unk> <eos>
 moreover the wilmington del. company is helped when prices weaken on the commodity chemicals it buys for its own production needs such as <unk> <eos>
 analysts are divided over whether du pont will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its <unk> inc. oil company <eos>
 the estimates for du pont range from $ N to $ N a share <eos>
 in the N third quarter the company earned $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion <eos>
 du pont declined to comment <eos>
 monsanto co. too is expected to continue reporting higher profit even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern europe and the western u.s. <eos>
 the st. <unk> company is expected to report again that losses in its <unk> searle & co. pharmaceutical business are narrowing <eos>
 searle continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year but monsanto has said it expects searle to post a profit for all of N <eos>
 most estimates for monsanto run between $ N and $ N a share <eos>
 a year ago the company posted third-quarter profit of $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion <eos>
 monsanto declined to comment <eos>
 but the <unk> producers are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle <eos>
 by some accounts on wall street and in the industry the inventory reductions are near an end which may <unk> firmer demand <eos>
 but <unk> say growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early 1990s <eos>
 in the latest quarter at least profit is expected to fall sharply <eos>
 for <unk> inc. how far down it is we do n't know says leslie <unk> at salomon brothers <eos>
 the projections are in the neighborhood of N cents a share to N cents compared with a restated $ N a share a year earlier when profit was $ N million on sales of $ N million <eos>
 <unk> faces lower prices for its mainstay product <unk> while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for <unk> whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries <eos>
 the company based in wilmington del. is <unk> by montedison s.p a. milan which has an offer outstanding for the <unk> shares it does n't already own <eos>
 at quantum chemical corp. new york the trouble is lower prices for polyethylene higher debt costs and the <unk> of an important plant due to an explosion <eos>
 some analysts hedge their estimates for quantum because it is n't known when the company will book certain one-time charges <eos>
 but the estimates range from break-even to N cents a share <eos>
 in the N third quarter quantum earned $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N million <eos>
 another big polyethylene producer union carbide corp. is expected to post profit of between $ N a share and $ N compared with $ N a share a year earlier when the company earned $ N million on sales of $ N billion <eos>
 <unk> quantum and union carbide all declined to comment <eos>

 the economy 's <unk> will be taken from several <unk> points this week with <unk> on trade output housing and inflation <eos>
 the most troublesome report may be the august merchandise trade deficit due out tomorrow <eos>
 the trade gap is expected to widen to about $ N billion from july 's $ N billion according to a survey by <unk> international a unit of mcgraw-hill inc. new york <eos>
 thursday 's report on the september consumer price index is expected to rise although not as sharply as the N N gain reported friday in the producer price index <eos>
 that gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in friday 's session before it got started on its reckless 190-point plunge <eos>
 economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in september reports on industrial production and capacity utilization also due tomorrow <eos>
 meanwhile september housing starts due wednesday are thought to have inched upward <eos>
 there 's a possibility of a surprise in the trade report said michael <unk> director of research at <unk> <eos>
 a widening of the deficit if it were combined with a <unk> strong dollar would <unk> trade problems but the dollar weakened friday as stocks plummeted <eos>
 in any event mr. <unk> and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made <eos>
 trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow he said <eos>
 exports are thought to have risen strongly in august but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports economists said <eos>
 views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read september 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more <unk> total employment figures in their calculations <eos>
 the wide range of estimates for the industrial output number <unk> the differences the forecasts run from a drop of N N to an increase of N N according to <unk> <eos>
 a rebound in energy prices which helped push up the producer price index is expected to do the same in the consumer price report <eos>
 the consensus view expects a N N increase in the september <unk> after a flat reading in august <eos>
 robert h. <unk> an economist for lloyd 's bank in new york is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the <unk> than in prices at the producer level <eos>
 auto prices had a big effect in the <unk> and at the <unk> level they wo n't he said <eos>
 food prices are expected to be unchanged but energy costs jumped as much as N N said gary <unk> economist at <unk> financial group <eos>
 he also says he thinks core inflation which <unk> the volatile food and energy prices was strong last month <eos>
 he expects a gain of as much as N N in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases <eos>
 housing starts are expected to <unk> a bit from august 's annual pace of N units <eos>
 economists say an august rebound in permits for <unk> units signaled an increase in september starts though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards <eos>

 assuming the stock market does n't crash again and completely <unk> <unk> and trading rooms american television audiences in a few months may be seeing britain 's concept of both <eos>
 capital city is a weekly series that <unk> here three weeks ago amid unprecedented <unk> by its producer <unk> television <eos>
 the early episodes make you long for a <unk> of the crash of N <eos>
 let 's make that N just to be sure <eos>
 according to the program 's publicity prospectus capital city set at <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> securities firm with # N million capital follows the fortunes of a <unk> team of young <unk> dealers hired for their particular <unk> of style <unk> and energy <eos>
 but with all the money and <unk> of high finance come the <unk> pressures to do well pressure to pull off another million before lunch pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second <eos>
 you need n't be a <unk> securities lawyer to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure <eos>
 the <unk> produced series has been criticized by london 's financial <unk> as inaccurate in detail but its major weakness is its <unk> <unk> of the characters ' professional and private lives <eos>
 turned loose in <unk> <unk> 's trading room the <unk> dealers do little right <eos>
 judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes <unk> <unk> 's capital should be just about exhausted by the final 13th week <eos>
 in the opening episode we learn that <unk> a junior bond trader has indeed pulled off another million before lunch <eos>
 trouble is she has lost it just as quickly <eos>
 rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world <unk> <unk> about it to a <unk> man while ordering lunch over the phone <eos>
 little chance that <unk> <unk> is going to recoup today <eos>
 traders spend the morning <unk> selling bonds in the belief that the u.s. monthly trade figures will look <unk> <eos>
 <unk> <unk> columbia <eos>
 the trade figures turn out well and all those recently <unk> bonds <unk> in price <eos>
 so much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second <eos>
 and a large <unk> of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly <unk> japanese bonds since when is anything japanese nearly <unk> <unk> <eos>
 surprisingly <unk> <unk> <unk> the week only to have a senior executive <unk> <unk> his way into becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation <eos>
 instead of closing ranks to protect the firm 's reputation the executive 's internal rivals led by a <unk> american demand his resignation <eos>
 the plot is <unk> when the firm 's major <unk> <unk> <unk> on the other side of the globe <unk> home to support the executive <eos>
 but the investigation continues <eos>
 if you can <unk> the <unk> that the rewards for such <unk> are <unk> salaries you still are left <unk> because few of the <unk> consume very <unk> <eos>
 in fact few consume much of anything <eos>
 two share a house almost <unk> of furniture <eos>
 <unk> lives in a hotel room and although she drives a <unk> <unk> she has n't time to clean or repair it the <unk> vehicle can be started only with a huge pair of <unk> because the <unk> key has broken off in the lock <eos>
 and it takes <unk> the <unk> <unk> ' man of the cast until the third episode to get past first base with any of his <unk> <eos>
 perhaps the explanation for these <unk> is that <unk> britain is n't ready to come to terms with the wealth created by the <unk> <unk> regime <eos>
 after all this is n't old money but new money and in many cases young money <eos>
 this attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of max the trading room 's most flamboyant character <eos>
 <unk> enough he lives in a <unk> <unk> converted church wears designer clothes and drives an <unk> car <eos>
 but apparently to make him <unk> even <unk> to the <unk> the script <unk> <unk> max into an <unk> <unk> master of N chinese <unk> <eos>
 he takes his wash to the <unk> where he meets a <unk> french girl who <unk> him into providing a home for her pet <unk> and then promptly <unk> his car and <unk> it in <unk> <eos>
 in producing and promoting capital city <unk> has spent about as much as <unk> <unk> loses on a good day <eos>
 the production costs are a not <unk> # N million $ N million and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of dealers an earlier <unk> movie <eos>
 another half million <unk> went for a <unk> of <unk> advertisements in six major british newspapers and for huge <unk> in the london subway <eos>
 these expenses create a special incentive for capital city 's producers to <unk> it or a <unk> version of it in america <eos>
 <unk> 's u.s. marketing agent donald <unk> is preparing to do just that <eos>
 he is <unk> hopeful citing three u.s. comedy series three 's company too close for comfort and check it out that had british <unk> <eos>
 perhaps without <unk> it mr. <unk> simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution capital city should have been a comedy a worthy <unk> to the <unk> british carry on movies of the 1960s <eos>
 the seeds already are in the script <eos>
 the first episode concluded with a <unk> <unk> scene in which the <unk> crew <unk> a baby the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm <eos>
 and many in the young cast bear striking <unk> to american tv and movie <unk> known for light roles <eos>
 <unk> <unk> looks like a young <unk> <unk> <unk> william armstrong who plays max could pass for <unk> <unk> and douglas <unk> <unk> for james <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> could easily double for <unk> hall the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> boys <unk> <eos>

 mr. <unk> is senior <unk> in the journal 's london bureau <eos>
 <unk> assurances of france gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ N billion acquisition of farmers group inc. in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine u.s. states where farmers operates <eos>
 the proposed acquisition is part of sir james goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for b.a.t industries plc the british tobacco retailing paper and financial services concern that is parent of los angeles-based farmers <eos>
 in an attempt to <unk> u.s. regulators ' concern over a goldsmith acquisition of farmers sir james in august agreed to sell farmers to axa if he is successful in acquiring b.a.t <eos>
 as part of the agreement axa agreed to invest $ N billion in <unk> investments ltd. sir james 's acquisition vehicle <eos>
 of the total $ N billion to be paid to <unk> by axa about $ N billion will come from available resources of axa 's parent <unk> group $ N billion will be in the form of notes issued by axa and the remaining $ N billion will be in long-term bank loans <eos>
 in an interview thursday <unk> bebear chairman and chief executive officer of axa said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by cie financiere de paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing <eos>
 the other banking companies in the group are credit lyonnais societe generale bankamerica corp. and citicorp he said <eos>
 mr. bebear said <unk> group has more than $ N billion of <unk> assets that we can and will sell to help pay off debt from the acquisition <eos>
 he said the assets to be sold would be <unk> assets including a beer company and a real estate firm and would n't include any pieces of farmers <eos>
 we wo n't put any burden on farmers he said <eos>
 the amended filings also point out that under a new agreement <unk> has an <unk> obligation to sell farmers to axa upon an acquisition of b.a.t <eos>
 we hope that with what we did the regulators will not need to evaluate <unk> and they can directly look at the agreement with us because <unk> wo n't be an owner of farmers at anytime mr. bebear said <eos>
 any change of control in farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where farmers and its related companies are incorporated <eos>
 the amended filings were required because of the new agreement between axa and <unk> and to reflect the extension that sir james received last month under british takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition <eos>
 <unk> dropped its initial # N billion $ N billion takeover bid after it received the extension but said it would launch a new bid if and when the <unk> sale of farmers to axa receives regulatory approval <eos>
 a spokesman for b.a.t said of the amended filings that it would appear that nothing <unk> has changed <eos>
 the new financing structure is still a <unk> leveraged one and axa still plans to take out N N of farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt <eos>
 that dividend is almost double the N N currently taken out of farmers by b.a.t the spokesman added <eos>
 it would have severe implications for farmers ' policy holders <eos>
 to fend off sir james 's advances b.a.t has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would <unk> it to a tobacco and financial services concern <eos>
 dismal sales at general motors corp. dragged the u.s. car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early october the first sales period of the N model year <eos>
 the eight major domestic auto makers sold N north <unk> cars in the first N days of october a N N drop from a year earlier <eos>
 domestically built truck sales were down N N to N <unk> vans and sport utility vehicles <eos>
 the heavy use of incentives to clear out N models appears to have taken the steam at least initially out of N model sales which began officially oct. N <eos>
 this appears particularly true at gm which had strong sales in august and september but saw its early october car and truck results fall N N from last year 's unusually high level <eos>
 overall sales of all <unk> vehicles fell N N from a year ago <eos>
 without gm overall sales for the other u.s. <unk> were roughly flat with N results <eos>
 some of the u.s. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many N models but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up <eos>
 we 've created a condition where without incentives it 's a tough market said tom kelly sales manager for bill <unk> chevrolet in dearborn mich <eos>
 car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of N million vehicles the lowest since october N <eos>
 the poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month <eos>
 furthermore dealers contacted late last week said they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of friday 's steep market decline <eos>
 gm 's domestic car sales dropped N N and its domestic trucks were down an even <unk> N N from the same period a year ago <eos>
 all of the gm divisions except cadillac showed big declines <eos>
 cadillac posted a N N increase despite new competition from lexus the <unk> luxury-car division of toyota motor corp <eos>
 lexus sales were n't available the cars are imported and toyota reports their sales only at <unk> <eos>
 the sales drop for the no. N car maker may have been caused in part by the end in september of dealer incentives that gm offered in addition to consumer rebates and <unk> financing a company spokesman said <eos>
 last year gm had a different program in place that continued rewarding dealers until all the N models had been sold <eos>
 aside from gm other car makers posted generally mixed results <eos>
 ford motor co. had a N N drop in domestic car sales but a N N increase in domestic truck sales <eos>
 chrysler corp. had a N N drop in car sales <unk> its generally slow performance all year <eos>
 however sales of trucks including the company 's popular minivans rose N N <eos>
 honda motor co. 's sales of domestically built vehicles plunged N N from a year earlier <eos>
 honda 's plant in <unk> ohio was <unk> up to build N model accords a honda spokesman said <eos>
 we 're really confident everything will bounce back to normal he added <eos>
 separately chrysler said firm prices on its <unk> domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of N N over <unk> equipped N models <eos>
 firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced earlier this fall <eos>
 at that time chrysler said base prices which are n't adjusted for equipment changes would rise between N N and N N on most vehicle <eos>

 in fact the network hopes to set up offices in warsaw and anywhere else in the east bloc that will have it <eos>
 but the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are <unk> the network 's life in more ways than one <eos>
 in fact radio free europe is in danger of suffering from its success <eos>
 while the network currently can operate freely in <unk> so can others <eos>
 in addition competition for <unk> is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled <eos>
 instead of being denounced as an evil agent of <unk> radio free europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too <unk> even boring <eos>
 they have a lot to do these days to compete with <unk> radio says andrew <unk> a <unk> student at the technical university in <unk> <eos>

 it proved a perfect time for radio free europe to ask for permission to set up office <eos>
 not only did the <unk> ministry of foreign affairs approve radio free europe 's new location but the ministry of telecommunications did something even more amazing they found us four phone lines in central <unk> says <unk> <unk> a radio free europe <unk> who helped <unk> the <unk> location <eos>
 that is a <unk> <eos>
 it 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network which had to overcome <unk> of its <unk> and <unk> of local <unk> who filed reports to the network by phone secret <unk> or letters <eos>
 in fact some of the network 's <unk> <unk> say they owe radio free europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the dark ages of the 20th century <eos>

 proposals for <unk> national service like <unk> <unk> up from time to time depress the resistance of the body <unk> run their course and seem to disappear only to <unk> and <unk> public life <unk> <eos>
 the disease <unk> comes to mind of course not as an <unk> on the advocates of national service <eos>
 rather it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing <unk> of a <unk> idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s along with <unk> <eos>
 it is back with us again in the form of legislation to pay <unk> under a national and community service act a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall <eos>
 why does the <unk> virus keep coming back <eos>
 perhaps it is because <unk> <unk> <unk> both military experience and the social <unk> <eos>
 if only we could get america 's <unk> youth into at least a <unk> uniform we might be able to teach <unk> again and revive the spirit of giving <eos>
 a quarter of a century ago national service was <unk> as a way of <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the draft by of all things expanding the draft <eos>
 those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many <unk> backers despite their protests that present plans contain no <unk> <eos>
 choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to <unk> national service as much as the draft <eos>
 but the virus was kept alive in <unk> departments until a couple of years ago when it again was let loose <eos>
 this time it attempted to <unk> two connected problems the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans <eos>
 why not keep and even expand the loans and grants the advocates <unk> but require some form of service from each <unk> <eos>
 military service moreover could be a <unk> option <eos>
 thus undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove <unk> <unk> <unk> conservatives <unk> <unk> and <unk> liberals <eos>
 the democratic leadership council a <unk> group <unk> the plan surely thought it might help the party to attract support especially among college students and their parents <eos>
 a provision allowing grants to be applied to <unk> purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of <unk> <eos>
 the <unk> plan <unk> <unk> <unk> trees <unk> <unk> <unk> children and <unk> <unk> for $ N a week tax free plus medical care <eos>
 with a tax-free $ N <unk> payment at the end of each year the <unk> would be making a wage comparable to $ N a year <eos>
 mind you most of the <unk> would be <unk> N to <unk> some not even high school graduates and many saving money by living at home <eos>
 they would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families <eos>
 as it happened political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system so the <unk> <unk> decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of give in order to get <eos>
 opposition to national service from the pentagon which wants to protect its own <unk> process also led to the <unk> option being dropped <eos>
 clearly a new rationale for national service had to be <unk> up <eos>
 what better place to turn than sen. edward kennedy 's labor committee that great <unk> of government <unk> where many a <unk> pot of <unk> is kept on the back <unk> until it can be brought forward and presented as <unk> <unk> <eos>
 before the <unk> is printed the house may add more <unk> also changing the initial price now posted at some $ N million <eos>
 it is widely known that too many <unk> <unk> the <unk> but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the <unk> especially if they are senators <eos>
 the omnibus bill coming out of congress may be <unk> <unk> but the <unk> chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the <unk> very hard <eos>
 the <unk> of <unk> is in the air <eos>
 is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance <eos>
 on the contrary it is as robust as ever <eos>
 according to the <unk> poll american adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen N N adjusted for inflation <eos>
 even if government does see various <unk> needs national service is not the way to meet them <eos>
 if we want to support students we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more <unk> based on something called <unk> rather than on the government 's idea of service <eos>
 or we might provide a tax credit for working students <eos>
 what we do not need to do is start a war and then try to justify it by creating a <unk> bill <eos>
 to the extent we lack manpower to staff <unk> jobs in hospitals for example we should raise pay pursue <unk> technology or allow more legal <unk> rather than <unk> high school graduates as short-term workers and cause <unk> among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs <eos>
 will national service in the current highly <unk> and <unk> form <unk> enough appeal to get adopted <eos>
 not necessarily <eos>
 polls show wide <unk> support for some vague concept of service but the bill now under discussion lacks any <unk> public backing <eos>
 nonetheless senate democrats are organizing a roll of supporting associations <unk> and <unk> some of which may hope to receive the paid <unk> <eos>
 so far the president seems <unk> to substitute any of the omnibus for his own <unk> proposal to <unk> a points of light foundation with $ N million to inform citizens of all ages and <unk> them to genuine <unk> <eos>
 however even this <unk> plan could become <unk> if the white house gives in to congressional democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in <unk> federal funds for volunteer projects <eos>
 there 's no need for such concessions <eos>
 the omnibus can be defeated the virus controlled and real service protected <eos>
 national service the <unk> idea still wo n't go away then of course but the millions of <unk> youth performing works of civic content will be <unk> only in the <unk> of their <unk> <eos>

 the debate over national service has begun again <eos>
 after a decade in which more than N <unk> established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a <unk> to high-school <unk> the focus has shifted to washington <eos>
 at least N bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in congress this spring <eos>
 one <unk> by sen. sam <unk> d. <unk> and rep. dave <unk> d. okla. would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served <eos>
 an omnibus bill assembled by sen. edward kennedy d. mass. and including some diluted <unk> provisions along with proposals by fellow democratic sens. <unk> <unk> barbara <unk> and christopher dodd has been reported out of the senate labor committee <eos>
 it might well win senate passage <eos>
 president bush has outlined his own youth entering service yes plan though its details remain to be specified <eos>
 what is one to think of all this <eos>
 doctrine and special interests govern some responses <eos>
 people eager to have youth pay their <unk> to society favor service proposals <unk> mandatory ones <eos>
 so do those who seek a <unk> concept of <unk> a concept imposing stern obligations as well as <unk> rights <eos>
 then there are <unk> opponents <eos>
 to <unk> mandatory service is an <unk> and voluntary systems are <unk> uses of tax money <eos>
 <unk> of the market question the value of the work national service would perform <eos>
 if the market wo n't pay for it they argue it ca n't be worth its cost <eos>
 elements of the left are also <unk> opposed they see service as a cover for the draft or fear the <unk> of youth or want to see rights <unk> not obligations <eos>
 but what about those of us whose views are not <unk> by formula or <unk> <eos>
 how should we think about national service <eos>
 let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion national service has no agreed meaning <eos>
 would service be voluntary or <unk> <eos>
 short or long <eos>
 <unk> or full-time <eos>
 paid or unpaid <eos>
 would participants live at home and work nearby or live in <unk> and work on public <unk> <eos>
 what kinds of work would they do <eos>
 what does national mean <eos>
 would the program be run by the federal government by local governments or by private voluntary organizations <eos>
 and who would serve <eos>
 only males as with the draft or both <unk> <eos>
 youth only or all ages <eos>
 middle-class people or poor people or a genuine <unk> <eos>
 many or few <eos>
 those are not <unk> questions and the label national service answers none of them <eos>
 then how should we think about national service <eos>
 as a starting point here are five <unk> N consider the <unk> not the name <eos>
 ignore national service in the <unk> consider specific proposals <eos>
 they will differ in crucial ways <eos>
 N service should be service <eos>
 as commonly understood service implies sacrifice <eos>
 it involves accepting risk or giving up income or deferring a career <eos>
 it follows that proposals like <unk> whose benefits to <unk> are worth some $ N a year do not qualify <eos>
 there is a rationale for such bills federal subsidies to college students amount to a <unk> bill without the <unk> <unk> those benefits should be earned not given <eos>
 but the earnings exceed by N N the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs <eos>
 why call that service <eos>
 N encouragement is fine <unk> is not <eos>
 <unk> service is unconstitutional <eos>
 it is also <unk> and <unk> <eos>
 who will throw several hundred thousand <unk> in jail each year <eos>
 but through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior <eos>
 it should also encourage service <unk> by all classes and all ages <eos>
 its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of <unk> in the u.s. should build on the service programs already in existence and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing <eos>
 N good programs are not cheap <eos>
 enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done <unk> forest fires fought housing <unk> students <unk> <unk> centers <unk> <eos>
 there is important work to be done and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even <unk> who start with few skills can do much of it well but not <unk> <eos>
 good service programs require <unk> <unk> training and supervision all of high quality <eos>
 they involve <unk> to participants <eos>
 full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision they are particularly expensive more per participant than a year at stanford or yale <eos>
 <unk> programs are cheaper but good ones still come to some $ N a year <eos>
 are they worth that <eos>
 <unk> suggest that good ones are especially so if the effects on participants are counted <eos>
 but the calculations are <unk> <eos>
 N <unk> youth are a special concern <eos>
 are such expenditures <unk> then <eos>
 yes if targeted <eos>
 people of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve but there are many ways for middle-class kids and their elders to serve at little public cost <eos>
 they can volunteer at any of thousands of <unk> institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers <eos>
 <unk> youth do n't have those opportunities <eos>
 they are not <unk> in high school or college <eos>
 they are unlikely to be employed <eos>
 and they have grown up in <unk> grim circumstances among family structures breaking down surrounded by <unk> <unk> and bleak prospects <eos>
 but many of them can be quite <unk> <unk> by productive and disciplined service <eos>
 some wo n't accept the discipline others drop out for other reasons <eos>
 but some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed <eos>
 learning skills producing something <unk> feeling useful they are no longer dependent others now depend on them <eos>
 even if it is cheaper to build <unk> or <unk> apartments or plant <unk> with paid professionals the effects on the young people providing those services alter the <unk> <eos>
 strictly speaking these youth are not performing service <eos>
 they are giving up no income deferring no careers <unk> no risk <eos>
 but they believe themselves to be serving and they begin to respect themselves and others to take control of their lives to think of the future <eos>
 that is a service to the nation <eos>
 it is what federal support should try hardest to achieve <eos>
 mr. <unk> a carter administration budget official heads his own washington-based strategic planning firm <eos>
 he is a co-author of national service what would it mean <eos>
 lexington books N <eos>
 government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a monday market <unk> but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet <eos>
 federal reserve chairman alan greenspan was on the telephones making it clear to officials in the u.s. and abroad that the fed was prepared to <unk> massive amounts of money into the banking system as it did in october N if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis <eos>
 and at the treasury secretary nicholas brady talked with friends and associates on wall street while assistant secretary david mullins carefully <unk> data on the friday market plunge <eos>
 but the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters <eos>
 in addition officials at the fed and in the bush administration decided that avoiding <unk> actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout <eos>
 the disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis said one government official insisting on <unk> <eos>
 the fed 's efforts at <unk> were partly <unk> sunday morning when both the new york times and the washington post carried stories <unk> a senior fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system monday morning <eos>
 fed chairman greenspan was surprised by both stories according to knowledgeable sources and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment <eos>
 nevertheless fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate <unk> of the central bank 's game plan <eos>
 it is prepared to assume the same role it played in october N providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat <eos>
 the fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions <eos>
 the <unk> of federal officials was evident in the appearance sunday of budget director richard darman on abc 's this week <eos>
 secretary of the treasury brady and chairman greenspan and the chairman of the sec and others have been in close contact <eos>
 i 'm sure they 'll do what 's right what 's prudent what 's <unk> he said <eos>
 when it was suggested his comment was a <unk> mr. darman replied it is a <unk> <eos>
 but in this context that 's the smart thing to do <eos>
 at the treasury secretary brady issued a statement <unk> the stock market 's drop <eos>
 today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy he said <eos>
 the economy remains <unk> and the outlook is for continued moderate growth <eos>
 but administration officials conceded that friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week <eos>
 one possibility is that this is a surgical setback reasonably limited in its <unk> and not a major problem said one senior administration official who also asked that he not be named <eos>
 the other is that we see another major disaster like two years ago <eos>
 i think that 's less likely <eos>
 nevertheless fed chairman greenspan and vice chairman manuel johnson were in their offices sunday evening monitoring events as they <unk> in markets around the world <eos>
 the action was expected to begin with the opening of the new zealand foreign exchange markets at N p.m. est when stocks there plunged and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in tokyo and through early this morning in europe <eos>
 both the treasury and the fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments <eos>
 in tokyo share prices dropped sharply by N N in early monday morning trading <eos>
 after the initial slide the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower <eos>
 in the bush administration the lead is being taken by treasury secretary brady undersecretary robert <unk> and assistant secretary mullins <eos>
 the three men worked together on the so-called brady commission headed by mr. brady which was established after the N crash to examine the market 's collapse <eos>
 as a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets and financial market crises <eos>
 mr. brady was at the white house friday afternoon when the stock market 's decline began <eos>
 he was quickly on the phone with mr. mullins who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the new york and chicago exchanges <eos>
 later mr. brady <unk> mr. greenspan sec chairman richard breeden and numerous contacts in new york and overseas <eos>
 aides say he continued to work the phones through the weekend <eos>
 administration officials say president bush was <unk> throughout friday afternoon and evening even after leaving for camp david <eos>
 he had frequent telephone <unk> with mr. brady and michael <unk> chairman of the counsel of economic advisers <eos>
 government officials tried throughout the weekend to <unk> a <unk> appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic <eos>
 treasury undersecretary david mulford for instance was at a meeting of the business council in hot springs va. when the stock market fell and remained there through the following day <eos>
 and as of last night fed chairman greenspan had n't canceled his plans to address the american bankers association convention in washington at N a.m. this morning <eos>
 ironically mr. greenspan was scheduled to address the same convention in dallas on oct. N N <eos>
 he flew to dallas on oct. N when the market plummeted N points but then turned around the next morning and returned to washington without delivering his speech <eos>

 resist the urge to call your broker and sell all your stocks <eos>
 that 's the advice of most investment professionals after friday 's 190-point drop in the dow jones industrial average <eos>
 no one can say for sure what will happen today <eos>
 and investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months <eos>
 but they 're nearly <unk> on one point do n't sell into a panic <eos>
 investors who sold everything after the crash of N lived to regret it <eos>
 even after friday 's plunge the dow jones industrial average was N N above where it landed on oct. N two years ago <eos>
 panic selling also was <unk> during other big declines in the past <eos>
 the crash of N was followed by a substantial recovery before the great depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began <eos>
 the october <unk> of N and N were scary but did n't lead to severe or sustained <unk> <eos>
 indeed some pros see friday 's plunge plus any further damage that might occur early this week as a chance for bargain hunting <eos>
 there has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash says stephen b. <unk> chief investment officer of chicago-based kemper financial services inc <eos>
 but most advisers think the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand pat <eos>
 when you see a runaway train says steve <unk> partner in the san francisco investment advisory firm brouwer & <unk> you wait for the train to stop <eos>
 even for people who expect a bear market in coming months and a sizable number of money managers and market <unk> do the advice is wait for the market to bounce back and sell shares gradually during rallies <eos>
 the best thing individual investors can do is just sit tight says marshall b. front executive vice president and head of investment counseling at stein roe & <unk> inc. a chicago-based investment counseling firm that manages about $ N billion <eos>
 on the one hand mr. front says it would be <unk> to sell into a classic panic <eos>
 on the other hand it 's not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy <eos>
 this is all <unk> right now and when <unk> starts to run it can run further than anyone anticipates he said <eos>
 so it 's more prudent to wait and see how things stabilize <eos>
 roger <unk> professor of finance at yale university and head of the market information firm <unk> associates inc. says my real advice would be to just ride through it <eos>
 generally it is n't <unk> to be in and out of the stock market <eos>
 mr. <unk> thinks that this week is going to be a roller-coaster week <eos>
 but he also thinks it is a good week to consider buying <eos>
 john <unk> former president of the los angeles chapter of the national association of investors corp. an organization of investment clubs and individual investors says his fellow club members did n't sell in the crash of N and see no reason to sell now <eos>
 we 're dedicated long-term investors not traders he says <eos>
 we understand <unk> and euphoria <eos>
 and we hope to take advantage of <unk> and buy stocks when they plunge <eos>
 one camp of investment pros sees what happened friday as an opportunity <eos>
 over the next days and weeks they say investors should look for stocks to buy <eos>
 friday 's action was an old-fashioned panic says alfred goldman director of technical market analysis for a.g. edwards & sons in st. louis <eos>
 stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price <eos>
 his advice you ought to be there with a basket catching them <eos>
 james craig portfolio manager for the <unk> <unk> fund which has one of the industry 's better track records started his buying during friday 's plunge <eos>
 stocks such as <unk> foods corp. <unk> stores inc. american international group inc. and federal national mortgage association became such bargains that he could n't resist them he says <eos>
 and mr. craig expects to pick up more shares today <eos>
 it will be chaotic at first but i would not be buying if i thought we were headed for real trouble he says <eos>
 he argues that stocks are reasonably valued now and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of N <eos>
 mr. front of stein roe suggests that any buying should concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction <eos>
 his firm favors selected computer drug and <unk> stocks <eos>
 other investment pros are more pessimistic <eos>
 they say investors should sell stocks but not necessarily right away <eos>
 many of them stress that the selling can be orderly gradual and done when stock prices are <unk> <eos>
 on thursday william <unk> a seattle money manager used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline <eos>
 he thinks the underlying inflation rate is around N N to N N far higher than most people <unk> <eos>
 in the pension accounts he manages mr. <unk> has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks partly as an inflation hedge <eos>
 he thinks government officials are <unk> to let a recession start when government corporate and personal debt levels are so high <eos>
 so he thinks the government will <unk> on the side of <unk> inflation <eos>
 as a result mr. <unk> says i think the ball game 's over and investors are about to face a bear market <eos>
 david m. jones vice president at <unk> g. <unk> & co. recommends treasury securities of up to five years ' maturity <eos>
 he says the oct. N employment report showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector is a warning sign to investors <eos>
 one strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge their bets is to buy put options either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index <eos>
 a put option gives its holder the right but not the obligation to sell a stock or stock index for a specified price the strike price until the option expires <eos>
 whether this insurance is <unk> depends on the cost of an option <eos>
 the cost or premium tends to get fat in times of crisis <eos>
 thus buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk <eos>
 the prices of puts generally did n't soar friday <eos>
 for example the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on eli lilly & co. moved up from N N at thursday 's close to only N N at friday 's close even though the shares dropped more than $ N <eos>
 but <unk> prices may <unk> when trading <unk> today <eos>
 it 's hard to <unk> about a reasonable price for puts <eos>
 but investors should keep in mind before paying too much that the average annual return for stock holdings long-term is N N to N N a year a return of N N is considered <unk> <eos>
 paying say N N for insurance against losses takes a deep <unk> out of the return <eos>

 <unk> banker commercial group said it sold $ N million of common stock to its employees at $ N a share giving them a total stake of more than N N in the commercial real estate brokerage firm <eos>
 the firm which was acquired in april from sears roebuck & co. in a management-led buy-out had planned to sell up to $ N million of stock or a N N stake in the company to its N employees <eos>
 though the offering did n't sell out james j. <unk> chairman and chief executive officer said we 're pretty proud of the employees ' response <eos>
 he noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan where a company usually <unk> money from third party lenders to buy stock that it sets aside to award employees over time here employees had to <unk> out their own cash for the stock <eos>
 they came up with their own money instead of borrowed money mr. <unk> said <eos>
 it 's totally different <eos>
 he said the offering was designed to create long-term incentives for employees <eos>
 we 're in a service business and in that context it 's vital to have your employees involved in the ownership so they have a stake in the success <eos>
 the brokerage firm wo n't pay a dividend on the stock <eos>
 employees have the right to trade stock among themselves and the company will establish an internal clearing house for these transactions <eos>
 they may also eventually sell the shares to third parties but the outside investors who own the remaining N N of <unk> banker have the right to first refusal <eos>
 those outside investors in <unk> banker include <unk> group a closely held washington d.c. merchant banking firm whose <unk> is frank <unk> former secretary of defense <unk> v. <unk> senior adviser to <unk> group mellon family trust of pittsburgh westinghouse credit corp. the financial services unit of westinghouse electric corp. bankers trust co. a unit of bankers trust new york corp. and a group of japanese investors represented by the investment banking unit of tokyo-based <unk> bank <eos>
 bankers trust and <unk> financed the $ N million acquisition from sears roebuck <eos>
 <unk> banker also named three outside director <unk> for its N member board <eos>
 the <unk> are gary wilson chief financial officer of walt disney co. james montgomery chief executive officer of great western financial corp. and peter <unk> former commissioner of baseball and now a private investor <eos>
 the first major event this morning in u.s. stock and futures trading may be a <unk> at the chicago mercantile exchange <eos>
 under a reform arising from the N crash trading in the merc 's stock-index futures will break for N minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from friday 's close a move equal to N points on the dow jones industrial average <eos>
 the aim of the <unk> would be to ease the opening of the new york stock exchange which would be <unk> by such a volatile move on the merc <eos>
 that <unk> <unk> is just one of a number of <unk> adopted after the N crash <eos>
 the big board also added computer capacity to handle huge <unk> in trading volume <eos>
 several of those post-crash changes kicked in during friday 's one-hour collapse and worked as expected even though they did n't prevent a stunning plunge <eos>
 but the major circuit breakers have yet to be <unk> <eos>
 a deeper market plunge today could give them their first test <eos>
 a further slide also would <unk> debate over a host of other more sweeping changes proposed but not implemented after the last crash <eos>
 most notably several of the regulatory steps recommended by the brady task force which <unk> the N crash would be revived especially because that group 's chairman is now the treasury secretary <eos>
 the most controversial of the brady recommendations involved establishing a single <unk> regulator to handle crucial <unk> questions such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets <eos>
 but for the moment attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended <eos>
 big board and merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the merc 's standard & poor 's N contract as well as <unk> communications among exchanges <eos>
 those <unk> from N p.m. to N p.m. <unk> and from N p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels <eos>
 during the first halt after the s&p index had fallen N points the big board 's <unk> computer program automatically was triggered <eos>
 that system is designed to separate <unk> program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks <eos>
 one merc broker compared the action in the s&p pit during the two <unk> to a fire at a <unk> school <eos>
 you do n't want the fire but you know what to do said howard <unk> an independent floor broker and a merc governor <eos>
 there was no panic <eos>
 the system worked the way we devised it to work <eos>
 after <unk> for about N minutes the s&p index tumbled to its <unk> limit and the second freeze went into effect <eos>
 traders then spent the last half-hour watching to see if the dow would drop N points mr. <unk> added referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour <eos>
 one <unk> estimated that N N to N N of the s&p traders were just standing around watching <eos>
 but the <unk> circuit breaker never had to kick in and <unk> on the chicago board of trade 's major market index also were n't triggered <eos>
 the mmi and the s&p N are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies <eos>
 the programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the N crash <eos>
 the process of post-crash reforms began with calls to <unk> the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments <eos>
 in october N just after the market drop washington was <unk> in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated <eos>
 over the next year that grand agenda was <unk> down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by <unk> trading to give market players time to <unk> and reconsider positions <eos>
 in addition limits were placed on computer-driven trading and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets <eos>
 few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated <eos>
 at the outset the prime target was program trading which was much discussed but little understood on capitol hill <eos>
 there were also calls to strip the stock markets of derivative products such as stock-index futures and options which federal judge stanley <unk> for example <unk> to <unk> attached to the basic market <eos>
 and there was much criticism of the new york stock exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists or market makers <eos>
 when the brady task force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in january N it immediately <unk> the reformers ' agenda <eos>
 arguing that the separate financial <unk> acted as one and concluding that the crash had raised the possibility of a <unk> financial system breakdown the presidential task force called for establishing a <unk> to oversee the markets to make margins consistent across markets to <unk> clearing systems and to install circuit breakers <eos>
 only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented <eos>
 the reagan white house held the brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel the working group on the financial markets to review its analysis and those of other crash studies <eos>
 in may N the working group made up of representatives from the federal reserve the treasury the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission finally endorsed only circuit breakers <eos>
 after several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets circuit breakers were set in place with the most notable <unk> trading after N and N point drops in the dow jones industrial average <eos>
 privately some free <unk> dismissed such <unk> as <unk> to <unk> <eos>
 after all this free-market argument went the dow only dropped more than N points once this century <eos>
 circuit breakers set to soften big drops <eos>
 if s&p futures fall N points at opening contract trading <unk> for N minutes <eos>
 if dow industrials fall N points at opening contract trading <unk> for N minutes <eos>
 if s&p futures fall N points equivalent to about N points on <unk> trading is frozen for half hour to that price or higher <eos>
 on nyse program trades are diverted into a separate computer file to determine buy and sell orders <eos>
 if s&p futures fall N points trading is restricted for an hour to that price or higher <eos>
 if dow industrials fall N points trading on the big board halts for an hour <eos>
 s&p and mmi contracts also halt <eos>
 if <unk> drops N points big board halts trading for two hours <eos>

 the newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to become very <unk> and reduce needed funds for investment in the already difficult state budget <eos>
 the aim of the <unk> measures was to <unk> economic growth which soared to N N last year to N N in N <eos>
 economists now predict the growth rate will be about N N for the year <eos>
 in a sign of growing official <unk> for <unk> russian orthodox <unk> were allowed to <unk> the <unk> anniversary of the moscow <unk> in the kremlin 's <unk> <unk> <unk> where <unk> were <unk> <eos>
 a <unk> $ N million <unk> of <unk> was completed on a hill outside hong kong facing china <eos>
 the <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> director of the <unk> lin <unk> who said hong kong is such a <unk> place we also need some kind of <unk> symbol <eos>
 it all seemed innocent enough last april one steven b. <unk> visited justin products inc. here identified himself as a potential customer and got the word on the little company 's new <unk> players for children <eos>
 it is almost identical to the sony product mr. <unk> <unk> after seeing <unk> and pictures <eos>
 replied a justin salesman exactly <eos>
 the justin merchandise carried wholesale prices some N N below those of sony corp. of japan 's my first sony line <eos>
 the <unk> <unk> enthusiastic and promised to return <eos>
 but instead of a new customer part of a <unk> <unk> from <unk> sony justin got a costly legal <unk> <eos>
 mr. <unk> it turned out was a private <unk> using a hidden tape recorder to gather information for sony <eos>
 his recording later turned up as a court exhibit <eos>
 seeking to keep justin 's my own product line off the u.s. market sony last may filed a suit in manhattan federal court <unk> the <unk> of trademark infringement unfair competition and other violations of business law <eos>
 since then life has changed a lot for <unk> leonard <unk> justin 's owner <eos>
 i have n't been able to get a decent night 's sleep since this has been going on he says <eos>
 it 's the most <unk> thing in my life i ca n't even attend to my business <eos>
 his company annual sales about $ N million may suffer a costly blow losing an estimated N N of total sales if sony annual sales about $ N billion <unk> <eos>
 justin 's plight shows what can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a <unk> multinational <eos>
 with considerable irony the case also shows how completely japan has turned the tables on u.s. business <eos>
 americans used to complain bitterly about being <unk> by <unk> products from japan <eos>
 now sony whose innovative <unk> products are among the most <unk> in consumer electronics is bitterly complaining about a little u.s. firm with a cheap <unk> produced in china <eos>
 the <unk> of this is that justin knocked off the sony line and sony wants to stop it says lewis h. <unk> sony 's attorney who previously <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <eos>
 sony itself declines to comment <eos>
 if sony wins mr. <unk> says its little rival will have to try to sell the products overseas <eos>
 at worst he adds they 'd have to <unk> them all up and throw them away <eos>
 mr. <unk> denies the suit 's charges and says his only mistake was taking on sony in the marketplace <eos>
 i made a similar line and i produced it cheaper he says <eos>
 today u.s. judge john e. <unk> is expected to rule on sony 's renewed request for a pre-trial order blocking sale of the disputed products on which deliveries began in july <eos>
 the judge turned down an earlier sony request for such an order a decision upheld on appeal but sony returned with additional evidence and arguments <eos>
 though hoping to settle the case justin <unk> to fight on if necessary <eos>
 but the battle is more than justin <unk> for <eos>
 i had no idea i was getting in so deep says mr. <unk> who founded justin in N <eos>
 mr. <unk> had sold <unk> inc. a taiwan electronics maker and retired only to find he was <unk> <eos>
 with justin he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in hong kong beginning with <unk> mouse <unk> <eos>
 the company has grown to about N employees from four initially mr. <unk> says <eos>
 justin has been profitable since N adds the official who shares his office with numerous teddy bears all samples from his line of <unk> toys <eos>
 like many others mr. <unk> took notice in N when sony in a classic example of market <unk> changed the plastic skin and <unk> on the famous <unk> line of portable audio equipment and created the my first sony line for children <eos>
 the <unk> <unk> new products looked more like toys than the adult models <eos>
 in court papers sony says it has spent more than $ N million to promote the line with resulting sales of over a million units <eos>
 sony found a new market niche but mr. <unk> figured that its prices left plenty of room for a <unk> competitor <eos>
 his products are n't exact copies of sony 's but strongly resemble them in size shape and especially color <eos>
 sony uses mostly red and blue with <unk> of yellow and so does justin on the theory that kids prefer these colors <eos>
 to be successful a product can be any color <unk> as long as it is <unk> red says charles e. <unk> justin 's attorney <eos>
 by last winter justin was showing <unk> at toy <unk> in hong kong and new york and sony noticed <eos>
 indeed concerned that sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other <unk> such as <unk> desirable sony products against justin 's customers mr. <unk> fired off a letter to sony in april <eos>
 he himself threatened to take the matter to the federal trade commission or u.s. justice department <eos>
 but justin has n't pursued those charges which were without merit according to mr. <unk> the sony attorney <eos>
 recalls mr. <unk> our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone <eos>
 we never intended taking on sony we do n't have the resources <eos>
 sony answered the empty threat with its real suit <eos>
 off and on since then the companies have <unk> in court <eos>
 and justin in a news release says once competitive sony now resorts to <unk> tactics in american <unk> to <unk> out and protect niche markets <eos>
 sony 's lawyer insists that the company 's tactics including the use of a private <unk> <unk> as a buyer are routine in such matters <eos>
 he also insists that sony no less than others has a legal right to protect its trade dress in this case mostly the colors that it claims make my first sony products distinctive <eos>
 justin claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before sony entered the children 's market <eos>
 whatever its merits sony 's aggressive defense is <unk> for justin <eos>
 it 's also costly <eos>
 mr. <unk> says he has paid more than $ N in legal fees so far <eos>
 of sony mr. <unk> says they know there 's no way for them to lose <eos>
 they just keep <unk> me in deeper until i reach the point where i give up and go away <eos>
 for now though he <unk> to hang in <eos>

 the market for $ N billion of high-risk junk bonds battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this year practically <unk> friday <eos>
 trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds only to find themselves <unk> by potential buyers <eos>
 stunned they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades <eos>
 the junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now there are no bids only offers says independent investor martin d. <unk> who manages nearly $ N billion and who recently decided to buy <unk> securities for a new fund <eos>
 this <unk> is far from over he says <eos>
 junk 's collapse helped <unk> the <unk> selling of stocks that produced the <unk> one-day dive in the dow jones industrial average since the oct. N N crash <eos>
 simultaneously it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the u.s. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the <unk> securities they could find <eos>
 but an <unk> <unk> <unk> the junk market friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite no active trading says john <unk> an economist at moody 's investors service inc <eos>
 for example the price of <unk> corp. 's $ N million of N N N bonds due N sold less than two years ago by goldman sachs & co. plummeted N N to just N cents on the dollar <eos>
 but not even goldman would make a market in the securities of <unk> the owner of the nationwide chain of N convenience stores that is strapped for cash <eos>
 goldman officials declined to comment <eos>
 junk bonds which <unk> from less than $ N billion at the start of this decade have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments <eos>
 the shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from campeau corp. which created its u.s. retailing empire with junk financing <eos>
 campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be <unk> on some interest payments and to put its prestigious <unk> department-store chain up for sale <eos>
 now dozens of corporations including <unk> allen tw services and york international that are counting on at least $ N billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat may never get the money <eos>
 the music has stopped playing says michael <unk> a principal in the investment firm of levy <unk> <eos>
 you 've either got a chair or you do n't <eos>
 in friday 's aftermath says r. douglas <unk> a director of high-yield finance at first boston corp. much of the $ N billion forward calendar could be deferred depending on the <unk> <eos>
 in august first boston withdrew a $ N million junk offering of ohio <unk> bonds because potential buyers were very <unk> <eos>
 the outlook looks shaky because we 're still waiting for mutual funds in particular to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual investors says king <unk> senior vice president at <unk> <unk> & <unk> an investment arm of xerox financial services <eos>
 indeed a moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of N high-yield mutual funds declined for the <unk> consecutive day friday <eos>
 in a stark contrast the benchmark 30-year treasury bond climbed more than N N points or about $ N for each $ N face amount to N N its biggest gain of the year <eos>
 the bond 's yield dropped to N N the lowest since march N N according to technical data global markets group <eos>
 the yield on three-month treasury bills considered the <unk> of all investments plummeted about N percentage point to N N the largest one-day decline since N <eos>
 the main catalyst for government bond market rally was the 190.58-point drop in the dow jones industrial average <eos>
 when you get panic in one market you get flight to quality in the other said maria ramirez money market economist at drexel burnham lambert inc <eos>
 nevertheless the problems of the junk market could prompt the federal reserve to ease credit in the months ahead <eos>
 this marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook says william sullivan director of money market research at dean witter reynolds inc. new york <eos>
 any sustained <unk> could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities <eos>
 robert dow a partner and portfolio manager at lord <unk> & co. which manages $ N billion of high-yield bonds says he does n't think there is any fundamental economic rationale for the junk bond rout <eos>
 it was <unk> <unk> <eos>
 he adds the junk market has <unk> some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets <unk> that means the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk <eos>
 i do n't believe that 's the case but i believe that people are running scared <eos>
 there is a flight to quality and the quality is not in equities and not in junk it 's in treasurys <eos>
 even as trading in high-yield issues <unk> up over the past month corporations sold more than $ N billion of new junk bonds <eos>
 for example a recent $ N million offering of <unk> gas services l.p. bonds sold by first boston was three times oversubscribed <eos>
 a $ N million offering of turner broadcasting system inc high-yield securities sold last week by drexel was increased $ N million because of strong demand <eos>
 first boston estimates that in november and december alone junk bond investors will receive $ N billion of coupon interest payments <eos>
 that 's a clear indication that there is and will be an <unk> of basic business going on says mr. <unk> of first boston <eos>
 i do n't know how people can say the junk bond market disappeared when there were $ N billion of orders for $ N million of junk bonds sold last week by turner says raymond <unk> <unk> of merchant banking at merrill lynch & co <eos>
 when the rally comes insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will <eos>
 there is plenty of money available from people who want to buy <unk> deals it 's the stuff that 's financed on a <unk> that people are wary of <eos>
 but such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have <unk> this year casting a pall over much of the junk market <eos>
 michael <unk> director of fixed-income research at kemper financial services says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer contributing to the slide in prices <eos>
 last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals he says <eos>
 this year at best it 's in one in every five or six <eos>
 and our credit standards have n't changed one <unk> <eos>
 however mr. <unk> said the slide in junk is creating one hell of a buying opportunity for selective buyers <eos>
 for the moment investors seem more <unk> with the bad junk than the good junk <eos>
 the market has been weak since the announcement of the campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by olympia & york says mr. <unk> of merrill lynch <eos>
 that really affected the market in that people started to ask what else is in trouble <eos>
 well before campeau though there were signs that the junk market was <unk> through one of its worst years ever <eos>
 despite the relatively strong economy junk bond prices did nothing except go down <unk> by a seemingly endless trail of bad news <eos>
 in june two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $ N billion of speculative debt securities new york-based integrated resources inc. said it ran out of borrowed money <eos>
 in july southmark corp. the dallas-based real estate and financial services company with about $ N billion of junk bonds voluntarily filed for protection under u.s. bankruptcy law <eos>
 by the end of july the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven-year treasury notes widened to more than N percentage points <eos>
 in august resorts international inc. which sold more than $ N million of junk bonds suspended interest payments <eos>
 in september just as the cash squeeze hit campeau <unk> financial corp. defaulted on $ N million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $ N billion of debt securities <eos>
 meantime regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of <unk> <eos>
 moody 's says the frequency of corporate credit <unk> is the highest this year since N <eos>
 in addition there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of N according to the federal deposit insurance corp <eos>
 the era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it says james grant editor of grant 's interest rate <unk> an early critic of the junk bond market <eos>
 what we 've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying <unk> compound interest <eos>
 businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings <eos>
 what we 're seeing now is the <unk> <unk> of asset values to a future when <unk> debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy <eos>
 friday 's market activity <eos>
 prices of treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a <unk> stock market <eos>
 the benchmark 30-year treasury bond was quoted N p.m. edt at N N compared with N N thursday up N N points <eos>
 the yield on the benchmark fell to N N the lowest since march N N according to technical data global markets group <eos>
 the flight to quality began late in the day and followed a <unk> fall in the stock market <eos>
 treasurys opened lower reacting <unk> to news that the producer price index a measure of inflation on the wholesale level accelerated in september <eos>
 bond prices barely <unk> until midday <eos>
 many bond market participants will be closely <unk> the action of the federal reserve which might repeat its october N injection of huge amounts of liquidity to <unk> the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession <eos>
 prices of municipals investment-grade <unk> and mortgage-backed bonds also rose but lagged behind their treasury counterparts <eos>
 mortgage securities rose in hectic trading with most of the activity concentrated in government national mortgage association N N coupon securities the most liquid mortgage issue <eos>
 the ginnie mae november N N issue ended at N N up N point on the day to yield about N N to a 12-year average life assumption <eos>
 investment-grade corporate bonds were up about N to N point <eos>
 but the yield spread between <unk> investment-grade issues and <unk> bonds widened <eos>
 and the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment-grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ N billion bond offering by the tennessee valley authority <eos>
 despite rumors that the tva 's long-awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets sources in the underwriting syndicate said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled <eos>
 one of the sources said the smaller portions of $ N million each of five-year and 10-year bonds have already been substantially oversubscribed <eos>
 municipal bonds rose as much as N point <eos>

 friday 's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come <unk> the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their N october crash and <unk> have been put in place to keep markets more orderly <eos>
 still the lesson is about the same on friday the 13th the market was spooked by washington <eos>
 the consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the ual takeover and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the ual trading halt <eos>
 still the consensus seems almost as wide that one <unk> bid is no reason to write down the value of all u.s. business <eos>
 this <unk> leads us to another piece of news moving on the dow jones <unk> shortly before the downturn the success of senate democrats in <unk> the capital gains tax cut <eos>
 the real value of all shares after all is directly <unk> by the tax on any profits all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not ordinary income <eos>
 and market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the house last month <eos>
 an hour before friday 's plunge that provision was stripped from the tax bill leaving it with $ N billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut <eos>
 there is a great deal to be said to be sure for <unk> the garbage out of the reconciliation bill <eos>
 it would be a good thing if congress started to decide issues <unk> on their individual merits without <unk> <eos>
 for one thing no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an <unk> vote <eos>
 since senate leaders have so far <unk> it up with procedural <unk> promises of a cleaner bill are suspect <eos>
 especially so since president bush has been weakened by the panama <unk> <eos>
 to the extent that the ual troubles contributed to the plunge they are another instance of washington 's <unk> fingers <eos>
 as the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course at some point the market will start to reject them <eos>
 but the airlines are <unk> a clear case given anti-takeover <unk> by secretary of transportation skinner who <unk> to believe safety will be <unk> if <unk> and british airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes <eos>
 worse congress has started to jump on the skinner <unk> <eos>
 james <unk> the minnesota democrat who chairs the public works and transportation committee 's aviation subcommittee has put an <unk> takeover bill on <unk> speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the american and united air lines bids <eos>
 it would give mr. skinner up to N days to review any bid for N N or more of the voting stock of any u.s. carrier with revenues of $ N billion or more <eos>
 so the ual deal has problems and the market loses N points <eos>
 <unk> mr. secretary and mr. congressman <eos>
 in the N crash remember the market was shaken by a danny <unk> proposal to tax takeovers out of <unk> <eos>
 even more important in our view was the treasury 's threat to <unk> the dollar <eos>
 the treasury is doing the same thing today <unk> the dollar is not under <unk> pressure <eos>
 also traders are in better shape today than in N to survive selling <unk> <eos>
 they are better capitalized <eos>
 they are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape <unk> and clearing and settlement delays <eos>
 the fed promises any needed liquidity <eos>
 the big board 's <unk> with the chicago board of trade has improved it will be interesting to learn if circuit breakers prove to be a good idea <eos>
 in any event some traders see stocks as <unk> today unlike N <eos>
 there is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be <unk> by a little <unk> and common sense in washington <eos>
 but on the bearish side that may be too much to expect <eos>
 first chicago corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $ N million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans <eos>
 the parent company of first national bank of chicago with $ N billion in assets said it set aside $ N million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries <eos>
 the addition on top of two big N additions to <unk> reserves brings the reserve to a level equaling N N of <unk> and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations <eos>
 first chicago since N has reduced its loans to such nations to $ N billion from $ N billion <eos>
 despite this loss first chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to raise capital <eos>
 during the quarter the company realized a pretax gain of $ N million from the sale of its first chicago investment <unk> unit <eos>
 combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped N N against last year 's third quarter to $ N million from $ N million <eos>
 gains from first chicago 's venture capital unit a big leveraged buy-out investor rose N N to $ N million from $ N million a year ago <eos>
 interest income and most fee income was strong <eos>
 greece 's second <unk> of general elections this year is slated for nov. N <eos>
 for those hoping to see a <unk> of political <unk> restored in view of greece 's <unk> <unk> under <unk> <unk> and subsequent three-month <unk> with a <unk> coalition government there is but one bright sign the scandals still <unk> former prime minister andreas <unk> and his fallen socialist government are like flies <unk> around a <unk> <unk> <eos>
 in the <unk> round of voting <unk> gave no clear mandate to any single political party <eos>
 the ad interim coalition government that emerged from <unk> <unk> was in <unk> little more than the <unk> <unk> of ideological <unk> on one side the <unk> new democracy party headed by <unk> <unk> <eos>
 on the other the so-called coalition of the left and progress a <unk> and rather deceptive title for a merger of the <unk> communist party of greece and its <unk> <unk> the <unk> left <eos>
 the <unk> bond for this <unk> <unk> was plain <unk> mr. <unk> 's party as common political enemy <eos>
 the <unk> goal was a <unk> of government corruption <unk> at all levels but the main marks were mr. <unk> and his <unk> associates <eos>
 in point of fact this <unk> was overdue by decades <eos>
 when reduced to <unk> status in <unk> <unk> <unk> however the notion <unk> into a promised assault with targets primarily for political gains not justice <eos>
 with regard to greece 's <unk> <unk> scandal mr. <unk> 's principal <unk> remains george <unk> former owner of the bank of <unk> and <unk> <unk> now <unk> in a jail cell in <unk> mass. from where he is fighting <unk> proceedings that would return him to greece <eos>
 mr. <unk> 's credibility is at best <unk> <eos>
 he has ample motive to shift the blame and his testimony has also been found less than <unk> on numerous points <eos>
 nevertheless the new democracy and communist parties herald his <unk> as proof of <unk> <unk> <eos>
 among <unk> questions are whether mr. <unk> received $ N million of stolen bank of <unk> funds and an additional $ N in <unk> as contended whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ N million in mr. <unk> 's bank and then <unk> off the interest and what <unk> 's cut was from the $ N million mr. <unk> <unk> <eos>
 two former ministers were so heavily <unk> in the <unk> affair that <unk> members of parliament voted to refer them to the special court <eos>
 but <unk> parliamentary probe was the case of millions of <unk> mr. <unk> <unk> into new democracy <unk> <eos>
 in the end the investigation produced only <unk> evidence and indications that point to <unk> not <unk> proof <eos>
 on another issue <unk> were told how their national intelligence agency the <unk> regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures including key opposition politicians journalists and <unk> cabinet members <eos>
 despite convincing arguments it was never established that mr. <unk> personally ordered or directed the <unk> <eos>
 the central weakness of the scandals debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and <unk> <eos>
 the coalition government tried to show that <unk> ministers had received hefty sums for <unk> the purchase of <unk> fighting falcon and mirage N combat aircraft produced by the <unk> general dynamics corp. and france 's <unk> <unk> dassault respectively <eos>
 naturally neither general dynamics nor dassault could be expected to <unk> its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid or not to various <unk> officials for services <unk> <eos>
 so it seems that mr. <unk> and his communist <unk> may have <unk> served mr. <unk> a moral victory on a <unk> <unk> whether guilty or not can now <unk> the <unk> <unk> the whole affair as a <unk> hunt at mr. <unk> 's expense <eos>
 but while <unk> high <unk> alone wo n't help <unk> regain power mr. <unk> should never be underestimated <eos>
 first came his predictable <unk> he charged the coalition of the left and progress had sold out its leftist <unk> by <unk> in a <unk> plot aimed at <unk> <unk> and <unk> the course of socialism in greece <eos>
 then to <unk> his credibility with the left he <unk> some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the <unk> <unk> <eos>
 next he continued to court the communists many of whom feel <unk> by the <unk> coalition 's birth by bringing into <unk> a <unk> communist party candidate <eos>
 for balance and in hopes of gaining some <unk> <unk> votes he managed to attract a former new democracy party representative and known political enemy of mr. <unk> <eos>
 thus <unk> heads for the polls not only with diminished <unk> but also with <unk> of approval from representatives of its <unk> <unk> <eos>
 crucial as these elections are for greece pressing issues of state are getting lost in the <unk> <eos>
 the country 's future nato participation remains <unk> for instance <eos>
 greece also must <unk> major pieces of legislation in preparation for the N targets of heightened common market cooperation <eos>
 greece 's <unk> relations with the u.s. need attention soon as well <eos>
 for one the current accord concerning u.s. military bases in greece <unk> in may N <eos>

 a federal appeals court in san francisco ruled that shareholders ca n't hold corporate officials liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media <unk> revealed substantial information about the product 's flaws <eos>
 the ruling stems from a N suit filed by shareholders of apple computer inc. claiming that company officials <unk> investors about the expected success of the <unk> computer introduced in N <eos>

 moreover to complete the entire <unk> glass purchase and <unk> existing debt donaldson said it is highly confident that it will be able to sell $ N million of junk bonds for vitro despite the current disarray in the junk bond market <eos>

 hilton currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses <eos>
 people familiar with hilton said over the weekend that the <unk> of the sell-off in hilton shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk-bond financing <eos>

 hilton officials said they were n't worried about the drop in the company 's stock <eos>

 <unk> <unk> in los angeles contributed to this column <eos>
 of all the one-time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease <eos>
 to take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment however the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms <eos>
 it must also evaluate the real-estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective <eos>
 specifically it must understand how real-estate markets <unk> to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities <eos>
 when a regional economy <unk> cold the local real-estate market gets <unk> <eos>
 in other words real-estate market indicators such as building permits and leasing activity plummet much further than a local economy in recession <eos>
 this was seen in the late 1960s in los angeles and the mid-1970s in new york <eos>
 but the reverse is also true when a region 's economy <unk> from a slowdown these real-estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy <eos>
 why do local real-estate markets <unk> to regional economic cycles <eos>
 because real-estate purchases and leases are such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth <eos>
 metropolitan detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment <eos>
 area employment dropped by N N from its N peak and retail sales were down N N <eos>
 however the real-estate market was hurt even more <eos>
 for example residential building permits in the trough year of N were off N N from the N peak level <eos>
 once metropolitan detroit 's economy rallied in the mid-1980s real estate rebounded <eos>
 building permits for example soared a staggering N N between N and the peak year of N <eos>
 where <unk> corporations and professional firms are now asking are today 's opportunities <eos>
 look no further than metropolitan houston and denver two of the most depressed overbuilt and potentially undervalued real-estate markets in the nation <eos>
 of course some observers have touted houston and denver for the past five years as a <unk> play <eos>
 but now appears to be the time to act <eos>
 metropolitan houston 's economy did drop and then <unk> in the years after its N peak <eos>
 in the mid-1980s employment was down as much as N N from the N peak and retail sales were off N N <eos>
 the real-estate market suffered even more severe setbacks <eos>
 office construction dropped N N <eos>
 the vacancy rate soared more than N N in nearly every product category and more than N N of office space was vacant <eos>
 to some observers the empty office buildings of houston 's <unk> <unk> were <unk> of a very troubled economy <eos>
 as usual the real-estate market had <unk> <eos>
 actually the region 's economy retained a firm foundation <eos>
 metropolitan houston 's population has held steady over the past six years <eos>
 and personal income after <unk> in the mid-1980s has returned to its N level in real dollar terms <eos>
 today metropolitan houston 's real-estate market is poised for a significant turnaround <eos>
 more than N jobs were added in <unk> houston last year primarily in biotechnology petrochemical processing and the computer industry <eos>
 this growth puts houston in the top five <unk> areas in the nation last year <eos>
 and forecasts project a N N to N N growth rate in jobs over the next few years nearly twice the national average <eos>
 denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-estate market has <unk> to the region 's economic trends although denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as houston <eos>
 by some measures metropolitan denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years <eos>
 its population has continued to increase since N the peak year of the economic cycle <eos>
 employment is now N N higher than in N <eos>
 buying income in real dollars actually increased N N between N and N the most recent year available <eos>
 the rates of increase however are less than the rapid growth of the boom years and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy <eos>
 in a <unk> <unk> therefore the region 's real-estate market all but collapsed in recent years <eos>
 housing building permits are down more than N N from their N <unk> <eos>
 although no one can predict when metropolitan denver 's real-estate market will rebound major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned such as a new convention center a major <unk> <unk> the metropolitan area and a new regional airport <eos>
 when denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster such a recovery could occur as early as next year business and consumer confidence will return and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will <unk> the general economic rebound <eos>
 what real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as houston 's or denver 's <eos>
 generally overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as washington new york and los angeles <eos>
 vacancy rates in the N N to N N range today may easily rise to the low to <unk> N range in a couple of years <eos>
 under these conditions even a <unk> out of economic growth catching cold in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the <unk> industry <unk> <unk> <eos>
 those looking for real-estate bargains in <unk> metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term three-year lease and wait for the bargains ahead <eos>

 <unk> industrial corp. said it expects its third-quarter net earnings to be between two cents and four cents a share compared with N cents a share a year ago <eos>
 analysts had been projecting that the company 's earnings would be between N cents and N cents a share <eos>
 the year-earlier third-quarter earnings amounted to $ N million <eos>
 the company said a drop in activity in the <unk> industry reduced sales volume at its two <unk> operations <eos>
 also the company said its commercial products operation failed to meet forecasts <eos>

 common cause asked both the senate ethics committee and the justice department to investigate $ N million in political gifts by arizona businessman charles keating to five u.s. senators who <unk> with <unk> regulators for him <eos>
 mr. keating is currently the subject of a $ N billion federal <unk> lawsuit <unk> him of bleeding off assets of a california thrift he controlled lincoln savings & loan association and driving it into <unk> <eos>
 fred <unk> president of common cause the <unk> citizens lobby said mr. keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers democratic sens. dennis <unk> of arizona alan cranston of california john glenn of ohio and donald <unk> of michigan and gop sen. john <unk> of arizona <eos>
 mr. <unk> based this on a statement by mr. keating that was quoted in a wall street journal story in april one question had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause <eos>
 i want to say in the most <unk> way i can i certainly hope so <eos>
 in a highly unusual meeting in sen. <unk> 's office in april N the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on lincoln <eos>
 according to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting the regulators said lincoln was gambling <unk> with <unk> ' federally insured money and was a <unk> time bomb <eos>
 mr. keating had complained that the regulators were being too <unk> <eos>
 the notes show that sen. <unk> called the federal home loan bank board 's regulations grossly unfair and that sen. glenn insisted that mr. keating 's thrift was viable and profitable <eos>
 for the next two years the bank board which at the time was the agency responsible for <unk> thrifts failed to act even after federal auditors warned in may N that mr. keating had caused lincoln to become insolvent <eos>
 lincoln 's parent company american continental corp. entered bankruptcy-law proceedings this april N and regulators seized the thrift the next day <eos>
 the newly formed resolution trust corp. successor to the bank board filed suit against mr. keating and several others on sept. N <eos>
 mr. keating has filed his own suit alleging that his property was taken illegally <eos>
 the cost to taxpayers of lincoln 's collapse has been estimated at as much as $ N billion <eos>
 details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers <eos>
 in the midst of his N re-election campaign sen. <unk> chairman of the senate banking committee returned $ N in contributions after a detroit newspaper said that mr. keating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators <eos>
 sen. <unk> after months of <unk> off intense press criticism returned $ N only last month shortly after the government formally accused mr. keating of <unk> lincoln <eos>
 in addition sen. <unk> last week disclosed that he <unk> had paid $ N to american continental as <unk> for trips he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to mr. keating 's vacation home at cat <unk> the <unk> from N through N <eos>
 sen. <unk> said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter fell between the cracks <eos>
 mr. keating his family members and associates also donated $ N to sen. <unk> 's congressional campaigns over the years according to press accounts <eos>
 but sen. <unk> says mr. keating broke off their friendship abruptly in N because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as mr. keating wanted <eos>
 he became very angry at that left my office and told a number of people that i was a <unk> sen. <unk> recalls <eos>
 in july california newspapers disclosed that mr. keating gave $ N in corporate funds to three tax-exempt voter registration organizations in N and N at the <unk> of sen. cranston who conceded that soliciting the money was a pretty stupid thing to do politically <eos>
 in addition sen. cranston received $ N in campaign donations through mr. keating and the california democratic party received $ N in corporate donations for a N <unk> drive that benefited the senator 's re-election campaign that year <eos>
 also in july ohio newspapers disclosed $ N in corporate donations by mr. keating to the national council on public policy a political committee controlled by sen. glenn <eos>
 that was in addition to $ N in direct campaign donations arranged by mr. keating to the ohio senator <eos>
 mr. <unk> said the senate ethics committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation as was done in the case of former house speaker james wright <eos>
 wilson <unk> staff director of the ethics panel would n't comment <eos>
 sen. <unk> said he would cooperate with any inquiry but that his conduct had been entirely proper <eos>
 sen. <unk> said he had been deeply concerned at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper but decided it was entirely appropriate for him to seek fair treatment for a <unk> <eos>
 sen. glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and i am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the senate ethics committee <eos>
 sen. <unk> said when all is said and done i expect to be fully <unk> <eos>
 sen. cranston who had already <unk> his help to the federal bureau of investigation in any investigation of mr. keating portrayed his role in N as <unk> regulators to act <eos>
 why did n't the bank board act sooner he said <eos>
 that is what common cause should ask be investigated <eos>

 when china opened its doors to foreign investors in N toy makers from hong kong were among the first to march in <eos>
 today with about N N of the companies ' products being made in china the chairman of the hong kong toys council dennis <unk> has suggested a new <unk> label made in china by hong kong companies <eos>
 the toy makers were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the british colony <eos>
 but in the wake of the <unk> in beijing on june N the hong kong toy industry is worrying about its strong <unk> on china <eos>
 although the manufacturers stress that production has n't been affected by china 's political turmoil they are looking for additional sites <eos>
 the toy makers and their foreign buyers cite uncertainty about china 's economic and political policies <eos>
 nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket says david <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of international <unk> group ltd <eos>
 indeed <unk> and other leading hong kong toy makers were setting up factories in southeast asia especially in thailand long before the massacre <eos>
 their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern china <eos>
 by diversifying supply sources the toy makers do n't intend to withdraw from china manufacturers and foreign buyers say <eos>
 it would n't be easy to <unk> quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern china during the past decade <eos>
 a supply of cheap labor and the access to hong kong 's port airport banks and support industries such as printing companies have made china 's <unk> province a premier manufacturing site <eos>
 south china is the most competitive source of toys in the world says henry <unk> executive director of <unk> <unk> toys consolidated ltd <eos>
 hong kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border <eos>
 in N exports of domestically produced toys and games fell N N from N to hk$ N billion us$ N billion <eos>
 but <unk> mainly from china jumped N N to hk$ N billion <eos>
 in N 's first seven months domestic exports fell N N to hk$ N billion while <unk> rose N N to hk$ N billion <eos>
 manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern china where an estimated N people are employed by the toy industry <eos>
 for the next few years like it or not china is going to be the main supplier says <unk> young vice president of <unk> enterprises ltd. one of the first big hong kong toy makers to move across the border <eos>
 in the meantime as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites they are focusing mainly on southeast asia <eos>
 several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in thailand including <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> industrial co. the toy manufacturer headed by mr. <unk> <eos>
 malaysia the philippines and indonesia also are being studied <eos>
 with the european community set to remove its internal trade barriers in N several hong kong companies are beginning to consider spain portugal and greece as possible manufacturing sites <eos>
 worries about china came just as hong kong 's toy industry was recovering from a N sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major u.s. companies <unk> of wonder inc. and <unk> industries inc <eos>
 hong kong manufacturers say large debt <unk> and other financial problems resulting from the N difficulties <unk> the local industry causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management <eos>
 the industry <unk> last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results <eos>
 still they long for a <unk> toy to <unk> retail sales in the u.s. hong kong 's biggest market for toys and games <eos>
 the <unk> thing the colony 's companies have to a u.s. <unk> this year is the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> series of action figures manufactured by <unk> holdings ltd <eos>
 introduced in <unk> the <unk> plastic <unk> are based on an american comic book and television series <eos>
 paul <unk> managing director of <unk> says N million <unk> <unk> have been sold placing the <unk> <unk> among the N <unk> toys in the u.s. <eos>
 should sales continue to be strong through the christmas season which accounts for about N N of u.s. retail toy sales mr. <unk> said the <unk> <unk> could make N a record sales year for <unk> <eos>
 other hong kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from N <eos>
 besides the lack of a <unk> product they cite the continued dominance of the u.s. market by <unk> entertainment system an expensive video game made by <unk> co. of japan <eos>
 <unk> buyers have little money left to spend on other products <eos>
 many of the toy makers ' problems started well before june N as a result of <unk> infrastructure and beijing 's <unk> programs launched late last year <eos>
 toy makers complain that electricity in <unk> has been provided only three days a week in recent months down from five days a week as the province 's rapid <unk> has <unk> its generating capacity <eos>
 manufacturers are upgrading <unk> power plants <eos>
 bank credit for china investments all but <unk> up following june N <eos>
 also concern exists that the <unk> beijing leadership will tighten its control of <unk> which has been the main laboratory for the <unk> policy and economic reforms <eos>
 but toy manufacturers and other <unk> say beijing will be <unk> from tightening controls on <unk> southern china <eos>
 they say china 's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to <unk> production in <unk> <eos>
 the chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports says mr. <unk> of <unk> <eos>
 the bush administration urging the supreme court to give states more <unk> to restrict abortions said <unk> have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents <eos>
 <unk> general kenneth <unk> argued that the N supreme court decision roe vs. wade recognizing a constitutional right to abortion was incorrect <eos>
 he also argued that the high court was wrong in N to rule that <unk> have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their parents <eos>
 the administration 's position was outlined in a <unk> brief filed in one of three abortion cases the supreme court will hear argued and will decide this term <eos>
 the administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion <eos>
 the administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by chief justice william <unk> last july when the high court upheld missouri 's abortion restrictions <eos>
 under that standard which <unk> the votes of only three of the nine justices a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a reasonable <unk> for adopting it <eos>
 that is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the supreme court 's test since N which requires a state to have a compelling reason for restricting abortion <eos>
 on the provisions of the minnesota law the bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows <unk> to go to court for a judge 's permission instead <eos>
 the case <unk> vs. minnesota will be argued nov. N <eos>
 aluminum co. of america hit hard by the strength of the dollar overseas said net income for the third quarter dropped N N to $ N million or $ N a share <eos>
 the nation 's no. N aluminum maker earned $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier <eos>
 revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion <eos>
 analysts who were expecting <unk> to post around $ N to $ N a share were surprised at the lackluster third-quarter results <eos>
 it 's disappointing said william <unk> an analyst with smith barney harris upham & co <eos>
 much of the earnings decline was led by <unk> rate adjustments which affected the bottom line by $ N million or N cents a share compared with $ N million or four cents a share the previous year <eos>
 lower prices for aluminum <unk> and certain <unk> products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings the company said <eos>
 in addition costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant <unk> for modernization work the company said <eos>
 excluding the higher tax rate which rose two percentage points to N N and the negative exchange rate adjustment the company would have met analysts ' expectations said r. wayne <unk> an analyst with goldman sachs & co <eos>
 noting that the third quarter is usually the aluminum industry 's <unk> mr. <unk> added the third quarter is never a bang up period for them anyway <eos>
 nevertheless the company said shipments were up slightly to N metric tons from N <unk> the impact of the unexpected earning decline <eos>
 the results were announced after the stock market closed <eos>
 in new york stock exchange composite trading friday <unk> closed at $ N a share down $ N in a sharply lower market <eos>
 for N years federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest-growing parts of the television business <eos>
 and for six years nbc abc and cbs have negotiated with hollywood studios in a <unk> attempt to change that <eos>
 but with foreign companies <unk> up u.s. movie studios the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever <eos>
 they hope the foreign deals will divide the hollywood opposition and <unk> congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from <unk> a piece of <unk> sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air <eos>
 even network executives however admit privately that victory either in congress or in talks with the studios is highly doubtful any time soon <eos>
 and so the networks also are pushing for new ways to <unk> the <unk> provisions known formally as the financial interest and <unk> rules <eos>
 that became clear last week with the disclosure that national broadcasting co. backed by the deep pockets of parent general electric co. had tried to help fund qintex australia ltd. 's <unk> $ N billion bid for mgm\/ua communications co <eos>
 nbc 's interest may revive the deal which mgm\/ua killed last week when the australian concern had trouble raising cash <eos>
 even if that deal is n't revived nbc hopes to find another <eos>
 our doors are open an nbc spokesman says <eos>
 nbc may yet find a way to take a passive minority interest in a <unk> without violating the rules <eos>
 and any nbc effort could prompt cbs inc. and abc 's parent capital cities\/abc inc. to look for ways of <unk> the <unk> regulations <eos>
 but the networks ' push may only <unk> an increasingly bitter <unk> between them and hollywood studios <eos>
 both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing <unk> restraints <eos>
 few people <unk> to the talks expect the studios to <unk> <eos>
 the networks still are <unk> in their authority over what shows get on the air charges motion picture association president jack <unk> the most <unk> opponent of <unk> the rules <eos>
 studios are <unk> to get shows in prime-time <unk> and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative <unk> sales he contends <eos>
 and that 's why the rules for the most part must stay in place he says <eos>
 studio executives in on the talks including officials at paramount communications inc. <unk> entertainment inc. warner communications inc. and mca inc. declined to be interviewed <eos>
 but mr. <unk> who represents the studios asserts the whole production industry to a man is on the side of preserving the rules <eos>
 such <unk> leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will <unk> <eos>
 they do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate says one network executive <eos>
 and there 's no indication that washington is prepared to address the rules <eos>
 that 's the problem is n't it <eos>
 indeed it is <eos>
 congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess urging the studios and the networks which license rights to air shows made by the studios to work out their own compromise <eos>
 but recent developments have made the networks and nbc president robert wright in particular ever more <unk> that the networks must be <unk> to survive <eos>
 the latest <unk> sony corp. 's plan to acquire columbia pictures entertainment inc. for $ N billion and to buy independent producer guber peters entertainment co. for $ N million <eos>
 i wonder what walter <unk> will think of the <unk> broadcast system <unk> evening news with dan rather broadcast exclusively from tokyo wrote <unk> <unk> an nbc vice president in a commentary in last week 's issue of broadcasting magazine <eos>
 in his article mr. <unk> who was in europe last week and unavailable complained that the <unk> restraints in <unk> rules have contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-u.s. enterprises <eos>
 he did n't mention that nbc in the meantime was hoping to assist australia 's qintex in buying <eos>
 an nbc spokesman <unk> that mr. <unk> 's <unk> was entirely consistent with nbc plans because the u.s. rules would limit nbc 's involvement in the qintex deal so severely as to be light years away from the type of <unk> deals available to sony and everyone else except the three networks <eos>
 the big three 's <unk> for deregulation began <unk> in the summer when the former time inc. went ahead with plans to acquire warner <eos>
 although time already had a long-term contract to buy movies from warner the merger will let time 's largely <unk> <unk> channel home box office own the warner movies aired on hbo a <unk> integration that is effectively blocked by <unk> regulations <eos>
 nbc 's mr. wright led the way in <unk> the networks ' inability to match a <unk> combination <eos>
 he spoke up again when the sony bid for columbia was announced <eos>
 since nbc 's interest in the qintex bid for mgm\/ua was disclosed mr. wright has n't been available for comment <eos>
 with a qintex deal nbc would move into <unk> territory possibly raising <unk> at the studios and in washington <eos>
 it 's never really been tested says william <unk> iii who as a top cbs executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted <eos>
 he now runs policy communications in washington consulting to media companies <eos>
 <unk> rules do n't <unk> block a network from buying a passive small stake in a company that profits from the <unk> <unk> networks ca n't enjoy <eos>
 hence nbc might be able to take say a N N stake in a company such as mgm\/ua <eos>
 if the transaction raised objections the studio 's <unk> operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake <eos>
 but such <unk> would still block the networks from <unk> a big chunk of the <unk> of <unk> <eos>
 under current rules even when a network fares well with a <unk> series abc for example made a killing in broadcasting its popular <unk> <unk> it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations <eos>
 instead abc will have to sell off the rights for a one-time fee <eos>
 the networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim for several years at the least <eos>
 six years ago they were <unk> close <eos>
 the <unk> federal communications commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules <eos>
 various evidence including a <unk> institution study of some N series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the 1960s showed the networks did n't <unk> <unk> control over the studios as had been alleged <eos>
 but just eight days before the rules were to die former president ronald reagan a one-time actor intervened on behalf of hollywood <eos>
 the fcc effort collapsed <eos>
 the networks and studios have <unk> ever since <eos>
 network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in washington but that seems unlikely <eos>
 in congress the issue <unk> it 's about money not program quality and hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue <eos>
 a spokesman for rep. edward j. markey <unk> who heads a subcommittee that oversees the fcc says mr. markey feels the world has been forever changed by the <unk> deal <eos>
 but he said mr. markey hopes this <unk> the networks and studios to work it out on their own <eos>
 and at the fcc meanwhile new chairman alfred c. <unk> has said he wants the two sides to <unk> out their own plan <eos>
 recognition equipment inc. said it settled a civil action filed against it by the federal government on behalf of the u.s. postal service <eos>
 the government sued the company in april seeking $ N and other unspecified damages related to an alleged <unk> scheme <eos>
 the suit named the company former chief executive officer william g. moore jr. former vice president robert w. <unk> and five defendants who were n't part of the company <eos>
 the suit charged the defendants with causing peter e. <unk> an <unk> of the postal service board of governors to accept $ N in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <eos>
 mr. <unk> was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined $ N for his role in the scheme <eos>
 in the agreement recognition agreed to pay the government $ N in return for the release of all claims against the company mr. moore and mr. <unk> <eos>
 the five additional defendants were n't parties to the settlement <eos>
 a trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began sept. N in federal court for the district of columbia <eos>
 they were indicted last october on charges of fraud theft and conspiracy related to an effort to win $ N million in postal service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment <eos>
 the company and its executives deny the charges <eos>
 in a related development recognition equipment said the postal service has barred the company from bidding on postal contracts for an additional N days <eos>
 the postal service originally suspended the company oct. N N and has been renewing the ban ever since <eos>
 the company said it will continue to pursue a lifting of the suspension <eos>
 intel corp. reported a N N drop in third-quarter net income partly because of a one-time charge for discontinued operations <eos>
 the big semiconductor and computer maker said it had net of $ N million or N cents down N N from $ N million or N cents a share <eos>
 the lower net included a charge of $ N million equal to N cents a share on an after-tax basis for the cost of abandoning a <unk> joint venture with siemens ag of west germany <eos>
 earning also fell from the year-ago period because of slowing <unk> demand <eos>
 sales amounted to $ N million down N N from $ N million <eos>
 intel 's stock rose in early over-the-counter trading friday as investors appeared relieved that the company 's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter 's earnings of $ N million or N cents a share and that sales actually exceeded the $ N million for the second period <eos>
 but intel later <unk> to the stock market 's plunge closing at $ N down $ N <eos>
 in august intel warned that third-quarter earnings might be flat to down from the previous period 's because of slowing sales growth of its N microprocessor start-up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of the company 's new N chip in the current quarter <eos>
 on friday andrew <unk> intel president and chief executive officer said intel 's business is strong <eos>
 our bookings improved as the quarter <unk> and september was especially good <eos>

 walter sisulu and the african national congress came home yesterday <eos>
 after N years in prison mr. sisulu the <unk> former <unk> of the liberation movement was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up <eos>
 at the same time six anc colleagues five of whom were arrested with him in N and sentenced to life <unk> were <unk> with their families at various places around the country <eos>
 and as the <unk> men returned to their homes the anc outlawed in south africa since N and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government <unk> returned to the streets of the country 's black <unk> <eos>
 a huge anc flag with black green and gold <unk> was <unk> over the <unk> gate at mr. sisulu 's modest house while on the street out front boys displayed the anc colors on their shirts <unk> and <unk> <eos>
 at the small <unk> home of <unk> <unk> a leading anc <unk> and a former <unk> in the group 's armed <unk> <unk> we <unk> <unk> stuck little anc flags in their hair and a man <unk> on an <unk> horn <unk> in anc <unk> <eos>
 i am happy to see the spirit of the people said mr. sisulu looking <unk> in a new gray suit <eos>
 as the crowd outside his home shouted anc anc the old man shot his <unk> into the air <eos>
 i 'm inspired by the mood of the people <eos>
 under the laws of the land the anc remains an illegal organization and its headquarters are still in <unk> <unk> <eos>
 but the <unk> release of the seven leaders who once formed the intellectual and <unk> core of the anc is a de <unk> <unk> of the movement and the <unk> of its internal <unk> <eos>
 the government can never put the anc back into the bottle again said <unk> <unk> a veteran <unk> activist on hand to welcome mr. sisulu <eos>
 things have gone too far for the government to stop them now <eos>
 there 's no turning back <eos>
 there was certainly no <unk> the tide of anc <unk> last night when hundreds of people <unk> into the <unk> cross <unk> church in <unk> for what became the first anc rally in the country in N years <eos>
 <unk> <unk> of anc and <unk> we <unk> shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the anc would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial <unk> on all fronts including the armed struggle <eos>
 and they called on the government to release nelson <unk> the anc 's leading figure who was jailed with them and remains in prison <eos>
 without him said mr. sisulu the <unk> of the others is only a <unk> <eos>
 president <unk> de <unk> released the anc men along with one of the founding members of the pan <unk> congress a rival liberation group as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government <eos>
 but pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this <unk> divided country <eos>
 as other <unk> governments particularly poland and the soviet union have recently discovered initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult if not impossible to control <eos>
 as the days go by the south african government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued <unk> of mr. <unk> as well as the continued banning of the anc and enforcement of the state of emergency <eos>
 if it does n't yield on these matters and eventually begin talking directly to the anc the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to <unk> and unrest <eos>
 if it does the large number of <unk> whites who oppose any concessions to the black majority will step up their <unk> and threats to take matters into their own hands <eos>
 the newly released anc leaders also will be under enormous pressure <eos>
 the government is watching closely to see if their presence in the <unk> leads to increased <unk> protests and violence if it does pretoria will use this as a reason to keep mr. <unk> behind bars <eos>
 pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life <unk> in the first place for sabotage and conspiracy to <unk> the government <eos>
 in addition the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the anc and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their <unk> <eos>
 in order to head off any divisions mr. <unk> in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released instructed them to report to the anc headquarters in <unk> as soon as possible <eos>
 the men also will be faced with <unk> the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many <unk> black <unk> the so-called young <unk> who are anxious to see the old <unk> in action <eos>
 says peter <unk> president of the south african youth congress we will be expecting them to act like leaders of the anc <eos>
 they never considered themselves to be anything else <eos>
 at last night 's rally they called on their <unk> to be firm yet disciplined in their opposition to apartheid <eos>
 we <unk> discipline because we know that the government is very very sensitive said andrew <unk> another early <unk> leader who is now N <eos>
 we want to see nelson <unk> and all our <unk> out of prison and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us <eos>
