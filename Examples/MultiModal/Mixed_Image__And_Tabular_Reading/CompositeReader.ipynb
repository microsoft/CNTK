    "# **Composite Data Readers Tutorial**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composite Reader** is a reader which takes several data deserializers and composes them into a single input read, which can then be used as an input map for a computation graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This Tutorial** walks through how to compose image data along side a feature vector for training where the prediction is 4 regressor outputs.  A common example of this might be in a robotics scenario where you need to compose the current image data with a feature vector representing the robot's current state which then produces 4 servo outputs or perhaps 4 different reward values for different possible actions to take.  The possibilities are really endless and therefor the need to understand this level of flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts** Beyond the ability to just compose data, this tutorial highlights the ability to use specific types of neural network layers for specific data inputs and then compose those together into a prediction where it is best.  This is not unlike the human sensory system with individual sensory systems specifically tuned to the type of signal input which produces more or less a feature map that is then consumed by the judgement engine to produce signal outputs that are understood by the rest of your body to produce actions."

    "\n",
    "You can find the actual file examples in this directory as .map (for the image files) and .ctf (for the feature data).  The combination of CTF files and image map files allows you to compose whatever kind of labels with any type of data you wish.  For example; you can use a 0 index class identifier in the images file should you be performing classification; however in this instance, we are performing regression on 4 output nodes and therefor take advantage of the label flexibility provided in the CTF format.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note:  You can also use fully qualified paths such as c:/data/images/image1.png to refer to your image as well.  The class labels in this specific scenario are unused, so we just use 0's.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The CTF file looks like:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  |features 0 0 1 |label 1 2 3 4   \n",
    "  |features 0 1 0 |label 4 3 2 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "All features must be in float format.  Either as integers or decimal point representation.  All features and labels must also be of the same shape.  If you have variable sized data, you should be using a sequence representation of that data, which is documented here: https://www.cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.io.html?highlight=ctf#cntk.io.CTFDeserializer.\n",

Since the definition of Squared Loss is the Sum of the Squares of our errors, we have a little math to do to understand our outputs.  Since there are 4 regressors nodes, we take 32.96 and divide by 4, which gives us: 8.24 as the average error on each node.  We then take the square root of that, which is 2.87.  Finally we divide this number by 2 as the error could have happened in 2 directions (positive or negative).  This means our average error for each regressor node with only 32 seconds of training is ~ 1.435.  Not half bad.  If we let it go for a while and converge I'm sure we would see this drop."
