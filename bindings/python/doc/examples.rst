Examples
========

The best way to learn about the APIs currently is to look at the
following examples in the [CNTK clone root]/bindings/python/examples
directory:

-  `MNIST <https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/v2.0.beta2.0/bindings/python/examples/MNIST/SimpleMNIST.py>`__:
   A fully connected feed-forward model for classification of MNIST
   images. (follow the instructions in
   Examples/Image/DataSets/MNIST/README.md)

-  `CifarResNet <https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/v2.0.beta2.0/bindings/python/examples/CifarResNet/CifarResNet.py>`__:
   An image classification ResNet model for training on the CIFAR image
   dataset. (follow the instructions in
   Examples/Image/DataSets/CIFAR-10/README.md to get the CIFAR dataset
   and convert it to the CNTK supported format)

-  `SequenceClassification <https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/v2.0.beta2.0/bindings/python/examples/SequenceClassification/SequenceClassification.py>`__:
   An LSTM sequence classification model for text data.

-  `Sequence2Sequence <https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/v2.0.beta2.0/bindings/python/examples/Sequence2Sequence/Sequence2Sequence.py>`__:
   A sequence to sequence grapheme to phoneme translation model that
   trains on the CMUDict corpus.

-  `NumpyInterop <https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/v2.0.beta2.0/bindings/python/examples/NumpyInterop/FeedForwardNet.py>`__
   - NumPy interoperability example showing how to train a simple feed-forward
   network with training data fed using NumPy arrays.

-  `LanguageUnderstanding <https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/v2.0.beta2.0/bindings/python/examples/LanguageUnderstanding/LanguageUnderstanding.py>`__
   - Language Understanding.
