Examples
========

The best way to learn about the APIs is to look at the
following examples in the [CNTK clone root]/Examples directory:

-  `MNIST <https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/v2.0.beta15.0/Examples/Image/Classification/MLP/Python/SimpleMNIST.py>`__:
   A fully connected feed-forward model for classification of MNIST
   images. (follow the instructions in
   Examples/Image/DataSets/MNIST/README.md)

-  `TrainResNet_CIFAR10 <https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/v2.0.beta15.0/Examples/Image/Classification/ResNet/Python/TrainResNet_CIFAR10.py>`__:
   An image classification ResNet model for training on the CIFAR image
   dataset. (follow the instructions in
   Examples/Image/DataSets/CIFAR-10/README.md to get the CIFAR dataset
   and convert it to the CNTK supported format)

-  `SequenceClassification <https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/v2.0.beta15.0/Examples/SequenceClassification/SimpleExample/Python/SequenceClassification.py>`__:
   An LSTM sequence classification model for text data.

-  `Sequence2Sequence <https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/v2.0.beta15.0/Examples/SequenceToSequence/CMUDict/Python/Sequence2Sequence.py>`__:
   A sequence to sequence grapheme to phoneme translation model that
   trains on the CMUDict corpus.

-  `NumpyInterop <https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/v2.0.beta15.0/Tutorials/NumpyInterop/FeedForwardNet.py>`__
   - NumPy interoperability example showing how to train a simple feed-forward
   network with training data fed using NumPy arrays.

-  `LanguageUnderstanding <https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/v2.0.beta15.0/Examples/LanguageUnderstanding/ATIS/Python/LanguageUnderstanding.py>`__
   - Language Understanding.

-  `Video <https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/v2.0.beta15.0/Examples/Video/GettingStarted/Python/Conv3D_UCF11.py>`__
   - Basic 3D convolution networks for deep learning on video tasks.
