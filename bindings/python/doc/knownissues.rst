Known Issues
============

This is a beta release meant for early users to try the bits and
provide feedback on the usability and functional aspects of the API.
**Also please expect the API to undergo changes over the coming
weeks, which may break backwards compatibility of programs written
against the beta release**.

-  Only a subset of the planned functionality is available; features
   like automatic LR and MB size search and API extensibility will
   become available over the next few weeks.
