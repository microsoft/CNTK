def Sequential(layers, name=''):
    '''
    Sequential(layers, name='')

    Layer factory function to create a composite that applies a sequence of layers (or any functions) onto an input.
    ``Sequential ([F, G, H])(x)`` means the same as ``H(G(F(x)))``.

    The list of functions may also include tuples of functions. In that case, each function
    in a tuple is applied to the input, and the result is a tuple containing the results of
    these function applications. If followed by another function (typ. ``plus`` or ``splice``),
    the tuple items form the arguments to that function.

    Intermediate values in the chain can be accessed by name by inserting a ``Label(name=...)`` layer.

    Note: An equivalent way of writing ``Sequential ([F, G, H])(x)`` is ``F >> G >> H``.

    Example:
     >>> from cntk.layers import *

     >>> # sequence classifier. Maps a one-hot word sequence to a scalar probability value.
     >>> # The recurrence is a Fold(), meaning only the final hidden state is produced.
     >>> # The Label() layer allows to access the final hidden layer by name.
     >>> model = Sequential([Embedding(300), Fold(LSTM(500)), Label('hidden'), Dense(1, activation=sigmoid)])
     >>> model.update_signature(Sequence[Tensor[30000]])
     >>> model.hidden.shape
         (500,)

     >>> # simple example that squares an input value
     >>> f = Sequential([C.log, lambda x: 2 * x, C.exp])  # the second function is a Python lambda
     >>> f.update_signature(1)
     >>> f([np.array([2])])     # log, times 2, exp is the same as computing the square
         array([[ 4.]], dtype=float32)

     >>> # using function tuples to implement a bidirectional LSTM
     >>> bi_lstm = Sequential([(Recurrence(LSTM(250)),                      # first tuple entry: forward pass
     ...                        Recurrence(LSTM(250), go_backwards=True)),  # second: backward pass
     ...                       splice])                                     # splice both on top of each other

     >>> # using function tuple to implement a ResNet block
     >>> # The function tuple applies all items to the input, and emits a tuple with the results
     >>> # that then act as the arguments to the next one.
     >>> # Here we say (Convolution(), identity), which generates two arguments to the next function,
     >>> # the first being the convolution, the second being the input passed through.
     >>> # Following that with plus() implements the ResNet formula.
     >>> from cntk.ops import plus, relu
     >>> resnet_layer = Sequential([(Convolution((3,3), 64, activation=None), # first tuple entry
     ...                             identity),                               # second tuple entry is a pass-through
     ...                            plus,                                     # this sums both
     ...                            relu])                                    # activation applied afterwards

     >>> # simple function-tuples example with values
     >>> f = Sequential([(lambda x: x * x, identity), splice])  # computes tuple (x^2, x) and splices both values
     >>> f.update_signature(1)
     >>> f([np.array([2])])
         array([[ 4.,  2.]], dtype=float32)

    Args:
      layers (list of :class:`~cntk.ops.functions.Function`, equivalent Python functions, tuples of functions, or lists thereof): the list of functions to apply in sequence.
        A tuple aplies each of its items to the input and results in a tuple value.
        An item that is a list will be flattened.

    Returns:
        cntk.ops.functions.Function:
        A function that accepts one argument and applies the given ``functions`` one after another.

def For(what_range, constructor, name=''):
    '''
    For(what_range, constructor, name='')

    Layer factory function to create a composite through a pattern similar to Python's `for` statement.

    This layer factory loops over the given range and passes each value to the constructor function.
    It is equivalent to
    ``Sequential([constructor(i) for i in what_range])``.

    It is acceptable that ``constructor`` takes no argument.

    Example:
     >>> from cntk.layers import *
     >>> from cntk.ops import relu

     >>> # stack of 3 Dense relu layers
     >>> model = For(range(3), lambda: Dense(2000, activation=relu))

     >>> # version of the above that has no activation for the last layer
     >>> model = For(range(3), lambda i: Dense(2000, activation=relu if i < 2 else identity))

     >>> # complex example that uses For() inside Sequential()
     >>> with default_options(activation=relu, pad=True):  # default activation is relu
     ...     model = Sequential([
     ...          For(range(2), lambda : [
     ...              Convolution2D((3,3), 64),
     ...              Convolution2D((3,3), 64),
     ...              MaxPooling((3,3), strides=2)
     ...          ]),
     ...          Label('ndfeat'),              # name this specific value
     ...          For(range(2), lambda i: [     # this passes a nested list to Sequential
     ...              Dense([256,128][i]),      # layer index i used to index into an array of parameters
     ...              Dropout(0.5)
     ...          ]),
     ...          Label('hidden'),
     ...          Dense(10, activation=None)    # activation parameter overrides default (which was set to relu)
     ...      ])
     >>> model.update_signature((3,32,32))      # RGB, 32 x 32 pixels
     >>> model.ndfeat.shape                     # shape at top of convo/pooling pyramid

def SequentialClique(functions, name=''):
    '''
    SequentialClique(functions, name='')

    Layer factory function to create a composite that applies a sequence of functions onto an input,
    with skip connections between all function. I.e. each function receives a sum of the input and all
    prior functions' outputs.

    Example:

def ResNetBlock(f, name=''):

    ResNetBlock(f, name='')

    Layer factory function to create a composite that adds a skip connection to a function.
    This is equivalent to ``Sequential((f, identity), plus)``.

    Example:

       the function to add the skip connection to.

    Returns:
        cntk.ops.functions.Function:
