\usage{
StreamDef(field = NULL, shape = NULL, is_sparse = FALSE,
  transforms = NULL, context = NULL, scp = NULL, mlf = NULL,
  broadcast = NULL, defines_mb_size = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{field}{string defining the name of the stream}

\item{shape}{- list of ints representing tensor shape integer defining the
dimensions of the stream}

\item{is_sparse}{logical for whether the data is sparse (FALSE by default)}

\item{transforms}{list of transforms to be applied to the Deserializer}

\item{context}{vector of length two defining whther reading in HTK data,
(only supported by `HTKFeatureDeserializer`)}

\item{scp}{list of `scp` files for HTK data}

\item{mlf}{list `mlf` files for HTK data}

\item{broadcast}{logical for whether the streams should be broadcast to the
whole sequence}

\item{defines_mb_size}{logical for whether this stream defines minibatch size}
}
\value{
A StreamDef object containing the stream dictionary
}
\description{
Configuration of a stream for use with the builtin Deserializers. The
meanings of some configuration keys have a mild dependency on the exact
deserializer, and certain keys are meaningless for certain deserializers.
