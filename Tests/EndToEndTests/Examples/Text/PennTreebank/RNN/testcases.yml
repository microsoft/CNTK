    # the complete suite (2 flavours x 2 devices) takes around
    # 7 minutes with the longest test (debug cpu)
    # running for ca. 4 minutes
    # In BVT, run Release GPU
    - bvt-e (build_sku=='gpu') and (device=='gpu') and (flavor=='release') 
    # In Nightly on Linux, run Debug GPU in addition
    - nightly-e (build_sku=='gpu')

testCases:
  CNTK Run must be completed:
    patterns:
      - __COMPLETED__

  Must train epochs in exactly same order and parameters:
    patterns:
      - Starting Epoch {{integer}}
      - learning rate per sample = {{float}}
      - momentum = {{float}}

  Epochs (with low train loss) must be finished with expected results:
    patterns:
      - Finished Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]
      - TrainNodeClassBasedCrossEntropy = {{float,tolerance=0.05}}
      - learningRatePerSample = {{float,tolerance=0.1%}}

  Per-minibatch (with low train loss) training results must match:
    patterns:
      - Minibatch[{{integer}}-{{integer}}
      - " * {{integer}}; "
      - TrainNodeClassBasedCrossEntropy = {{float,tolerance=0.05}}
      - perplexity = {{float,tolerance=0.1%}}
