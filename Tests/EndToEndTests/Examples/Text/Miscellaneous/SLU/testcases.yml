testCases:
  CNTK Run must be completed:
    patterns:
      - __COMPLETED__

  Must train epochs in exactly same order and parameters:
    patterns:
      - Starting Epoch {{integer}}
      - learning rate per sample = {{float}}
      - momentum = {{float}}

  Epochs must be finished with expected results (validation set):
    patterns:
      - "Finished Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]: [Validation Set]"
      - TrainLossPerSample = {{float,tolerance=.1%}}
      
  Epochs must be finished with expected results (training set):
    patterns:
      - "Finished Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]: [Training Set]"
      - TrainLossPerSample = {{float,tolerance=.1%}}
      - TotalSamplesSeen = {{integer}}
      - AvgLearningRatePerSample = {{float,tolerance=0.001%}}

  Per-minibatch (with low train loss) training results must match:
    patterns:
      - Minibatch[{{integer}}-{{integer}}
      - SamplesSeen = {{integer}}
      - CrossEntropyWithSoftmax/Sample = {{float,tolerance=0.05}}
      - Perplexity = {{float,tolerance=0.05}}
