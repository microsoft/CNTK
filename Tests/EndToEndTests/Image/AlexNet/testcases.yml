     # running on every BVT job in 'I' (Image) leg:
     - bvt-i  (build_sku == 'gpu') and (device=='gpu') and (flavor=='release')
     # running every Nightly job in 'I' leg
     - nightly-i (build_sku == 'gpu') and (device=='gpu') and (flavor=='release')

testCases:
  CNTK Run must be completed:
    patterns:
      - __COMPLETED__

  Must train epochs in exactly same order and parameters:
    patterns:
      - Starting Epoch {{integer}}
      - learning rate per sample = {{float}}
      - momentum = {{float}}

  Epochs must be finished with expected results:
    patterns:
      - Finished Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]
      - ce = {{float,tolerance=2.0%}}
      - err = {{float,tolerance=2.0%}}
      - learningRatePerSample = {{float,tolerance=0.001%}}

  Per-minibatch training results must match:
    patterns:
      - Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]-Minibatch[{{integer}}-{{integer}}
      - " * {{integer}}; "
      - ce = {{float,tolerance=2.0%}}
