     # running on every BVT job in 'S' (Speech) leg in Debug-GPU and Release-CPU configurations:

testCases:
  CNTK Run must be completed:
    patterns:
      - __COMPLETED__

  Must train epochs in exactly same order and parameters:
    patterns:
      - Starting Epoch {{integer}}
      - learning rate per sample = {{float}}
      - momentum = {{float}}

  Epochs must be finished with expected results:
    patterns:
      - Finished Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]
      - TrainLossPerSample = {{float,tolerance=.5%}}
      # TODO GPU has an initial EvalErr rate which is larger than on CPU and otherwise. 
      # In later epochs the results are aligned. Why?
      - EvalErrPerSample = {{float,tolerance=13%}}
      - AvgLearningRatePerSample = {{float,tolerance=0.001%}}

#  Per-minibatch training results must match:
#    patterns:
#      - Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]-Minibatch[{{integer}}-{{integer}}
#      - SamplesSeen = {{integer}}
#      - TrainLossPerSample = {{float,tolerance=.5%}}
#      - EvalErr[0]PerSample = {{float,tolerance=.5%}}
