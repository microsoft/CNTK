testCases:
  CNTK Run must be completed:
    patterns:
      - __COMPLETED__

# Note: These log messages have been removed.
#  Must train epochs in exactly same order and parameters:
#    patterns:
#      - Starting Epoch {{integer}}
#      - learning rate per sample = {{float}}
#      - momentum = {{float}}

  Epochs must be finished with expected results:
    patterns:
      - Finished Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]
      - ce = {{float,tolerance=.5%}}
      # TODO GPU has an initial EvalErr rate which is larger than on CPU and otherwise. 
      # In later epochs the results are aligned. Why?
      - err = {{float,tolerance=13%}}
      - learningRatePerSample = {{float,tolerance=0.001%}}

#  Per-minibatch training results must match:
#    patterns:
#      - Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]-Minibatch[{{integer}}-{{integer}}
#      - " * {{integer}}; "
#      - ce = {{float,tolerance=.5%}}
#      - EvalClassificationError = {{float,tolerance=.5%}}
