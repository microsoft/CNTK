     # running on every BVT job in 'S' (Speech) leg in Debug-GPU configuration:

testCases:
  CNTK Run must be completed:
    patterns:
      - __COMPLETED__

  Must train epochs in exactly same order and parameters:
    patterns:
      - Starting Epoch {{integer}}
      - learning rate per sample = {{float}}
      - momentum = {{float}}

  Epochs must be finished with expected results:
    patterns:
      - Finished Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]
      - TrainLossPerSample = {{float,tolerance=.1%}}
      - EvalErrPerSample = {{float,tolerance=.25%}}
      - AvgLearningRatePerSample = {{float,tolerance=0.001%}}

  Per-minibatch training results must match:
    patterns:
      - Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]-Minibatch[{{integer}}-{{integer}}
      - SamplesSeen = {{integer}}
      - TrainLossPerSample = {{float,tolerance=.2%}}
