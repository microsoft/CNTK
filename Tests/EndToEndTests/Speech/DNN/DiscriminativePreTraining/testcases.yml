     # BUGBUG: Temporarily disabling this test on the CPU since in Jenkins
     # we have some old machines with CPUs without AVX and when this test runs on these
     # old CPUs, it produces results different enough to cause the tests to fail
     # In the longer term the old machines will be retired but for now this test
     # is being disabled on the CPU until the retirement of those machines
     - bvt-s (build_sku == 'gpu') and (device == 'gpu') and ((flavor == 'debug') ^ (os == 'windows'))
     - nightly-s (build_sku == 'gpu') and (device == 'gpu')
     - weekly-s (build_sku == 'gpu') and (device == 'gpu')

testCases:
  CNTK Run must be completed:
    patterns:
      - __COMPLETED__

  Must train epochs in exactly same order and parameters:
    patterns:
      - Starting Epoch {{integer}}
      - learning rate per sample = {{float}}
      - momentum = {{float}}

  Epochs must be finished with expected results:
    patterns:
      - Finished Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]
      - ce = {{float,tolerance=.1%}}
      - err = {{float,tolerance=.25%}}
      - learningRatePerSample = {{float,tolerance=0.001%}}

  Per-minibatch training results must match:
    patterns:
      - Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]-Minibatch[{{integer}}-{{integer}}
      - " * {{integer}}; "
      - ce = {{float,tolerance=.2%}}
