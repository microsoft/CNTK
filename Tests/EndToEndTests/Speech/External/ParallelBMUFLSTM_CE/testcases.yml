testCases:

  Epochs must be finished with expected results for each MPI Rank:
    patterns:
      - ^MPI Rank {{integer}}
      - Finished Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]
      - cr = {{float,tolerance=1%}} * {{integer}}
      - Err = {{float,tolerance=1%}} * {{integer}} 
      - totalSamplesSeen = {{integer}}
