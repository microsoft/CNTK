# CNTK Tuturial: Language Understanding

## Overview

In this tutorial we will walk through several complete CNTK examples, showing 
•how to describe a network in our network-description language BrainScript; 
•how to set the learning parameters; and 
•how to read in, and write out, data

We will start with a simple implementation of binary classification using the linear model Logistic Regression. From there, we will expand to multiclass classification towards the end of this tutorial. Our next tutorial will tackle a more complex multiclass classification problem that will greatly benefit from a deep network architecture.
