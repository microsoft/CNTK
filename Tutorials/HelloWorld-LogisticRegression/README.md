# CNTK Tuturial: Logistic regression and multiclass classification

## Overview

In this tutorial we will walk through several complete CNTK examples, showing 
* how to describe a network in our network-description language BrainScript; 
* how to set the learning parameters; and 
* how to read in, and write out, data

We will start with a simple implementation of binary classification using the linear model Logistic Regression. From there, we will expand to multiclass classification towards the end of this tutorial.
