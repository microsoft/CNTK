# Functional API Tutorials

This folder is the staging area for Tutorials written using the Python Functional API. 
The plan is to have each Tutorial in the parent folder translated to a more succinct style in this folder.
All Tutorials here are fully tested, same as the Tutorials in the parent folder.
