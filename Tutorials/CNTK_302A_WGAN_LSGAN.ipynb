    "# CNTK 302 Part A: Wasserstein GAN and Loss Sensitive GAN with CIFAR Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites: ** We assume that you have successfully downloaded the CIFAR data by completing tutorial CNTK 201A. Or you can run the CNTK 201A image data downloader notebook to download and prepare CIFAR dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Generative models have gained a lot of attention in deep learning community which has traditionally leveraged discriminative  models for semi-supervised and unsupervised learning. [Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661v1.pdf) (Goodfellow *et al.*, 2014) is one of the most popular generative model because of its promising results in [various tasks](https://github.com/HKCaesar/really-awesome-gan) in computer vision and natural language processing. However, the original version of GANs are notorious for being difficult to train. Without carefully-chosen hyper-parameters and network architecture that balances Generator and Discriminator training, GANs could easily suffer from vanishing gradient or mode collapse (where the model is only able to produce a single or a few samples). In this tutorial, we introduce several improved GAN models, namely [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf) (W-GAN) (Arjovsky *et al.*, 2017) and [Loss Sensitive GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06264.pdf) (LS-GAN) (Qi, 2017), that are proposed to address the problems of vanishing gradient and mode collapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this section, we will briefly overview of main differences between Wasserstein GANs and original GANs in both theory and implementation perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is GAN hard to train?\n",
    "In [the original GAN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661v1.pdf), GAN includes two neural network, a Generator $G$ and a Discriminator $D$. The training of GAN is modeled as a two-player zeros-sum game. The Discriminator D is trained to predict the probability that a sample is a real sample rather than generated from the generator G, while the generator G is trained to better fool the discriminator by producing real-looking samples. The objective for GAN training is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min_G\\max_D V(D,G)=\\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim p_{data}(x)}[\\log D(x)] + \\mathbb{E}_{z\\sim p_z(x)}[\\log(1-D(G(z)))]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original GAN paper, the author proves that the optimal strategy for discriminator is predicting\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D^*(x)=\\frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x)+p_{model}(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By plugging it into the GAN objective function, one may find that the discriminator is actually an estimation of *Jensen-Shannon* divergence (JS divergence or JSD) of two distributions (data and model).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(D^*,g_\\theta)=2 JSD(\\mathbb{P}_{data}\\|\\mathbb{P}_{model}) - 2\\log2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "JS distance may become locally saturated and gets vanishing gradient to train the GAN generator if the discriminator is over-trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wasserstein GAN\n",
    "To address this problem, [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf) was proposed to use a different distance measurement for probability distributions, namely *Earth-Mover* (EM) distance or *Wasserstein* distance instead of JS divergence. The authors claimed that by using EM distance, one no longer needs to carefully maintain the balance between the generator and the discriminator, and, notably, the output of the discriminator (they call it critic instead in the paper), which is an estimation of EM distance serves as a good indicator of image quality of generated samples. The EM distance of two distribution is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W(p_{data}, p_{model})=\\inf_{\\gamma\\in\\prod(p_{data},p_{model})}\\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\\sim\\gamma}\\left[\\|x-y\\|\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper shows that EM distance is a more sensible distance measurement than JS divergence since EM distance is continuous and differentiable anywhere while JS divergence is not. The authors uses the  Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality to derive the objective for Wasserstein GAN,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min_G\\max_{\\|D\\|_L\\leq K} \\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim p_{data}(x)}[D(x)] - \\mathbb{E}_{z\\sim p_z(x)}[D(G(z))]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: **the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality requires the function to be K-Lipschitz. The authors suggests *clipping the weights of discriminator* to satisfy Lipschitz continuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation details\n",
    "\n",
    "The modification needed on implementation side is minor. On can change an original GAN into a Wasserstein GAN with a few lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use W-GAN loss function\n",
    "2. Remove the sigmoid activation for the last layer of discriminator\n",
    "3. Clip the weights of the discriminator after updates (e.g., to [-0.01, 0.01])\n",
    "4. Train discriminator more iterations than generator (e.g., train the discriminator for 5 iterations and train the generator for one iteration only at each round)\n",
    "5. Use non-momentum-based optimizer (e.g., RMSProp) instead of Adam (Note: in this tutorial we use Adam with `momentum=0`)\n",
    "6. Use small learning rate (e.g., 0.00005)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Sensitive GAN\n",
    "\n",
    "[Loss Sensitive GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06264.pdf) was proposed to address the problem of vanishing gradient. LS-GAN is trained on a loss function that allows the generator to focus on improving poor generated samples that are far from the real sample manifold. The author shows that the loss learned by LS-GAN has non-vanishing gradient almost everywhere, even when the discriminator is over-trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min_D L_D = \\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim p_{data}(x)}[D(x)] + \\lambda\\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim p_{data}(x), z\\sim p_z(x)}\\left[\\left(\\|x-G(z)\\|_1 + D(x) - D(G(z))\\right)_+\\right]$$\n",
    "$$\\min_G L_G = \\mathbb{E}_{z\\sim p_z(x)}[D(G(z))]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation details\n",
    "\n",
    "The modification needed on implementation side is also minor. On can change an original GAN into a Wasserstein GAN with a few lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the LS-GAN loss function\n",
    "2. Remove the sigmoid activation for the last layer of discriminator\n",
    "3. Update both the generator and the discriminator with weight decay\n",
    "4. Train discriminator and generator each with one iteration at each round"
