    "# CNTK 303: Deep Structured Semantic Modeling with LSTM Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "DSSM stands for Deep Structured Semantic Model, or more general, Deep Semantic Similarity Model. DSSM, developed by the MSR Deep Learning Technology Center(DLTC), is a deep neural network (DNN) modeling technique for representing text strings (sentences, queries, predicates, entity mentions, etc.) in a continuous semantic space and modeling semantic similarity between two text strings (e.g., Sent2Vec). DSSM has wide applications including information retrieval and web search ranking ([Huang et al. 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/learning-deep-structured-semantic-models-for-web-search-using-clickthrough-data/); [Shen et al. 2014a](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/learning-semantic-representations-using-convolutional-neural-networks-for-web-search/),[2014b](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-latent-semantic-model-with-convolutional-pooling-structure-for-information-retrieval/)), ad selection/relevance, contextual entity search and interestingness tasks ([Gao et al. 2014a](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/modeling-interestingness-with-deep-neural-networks/), question answering ([Yih et al., 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/semantic-parsing-for-single-relation-question-answering/)), image captioning ([Fang et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4952)), and machine translation ([Gao et al., 2014b](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/learning-continuous-phrase-representations-for-translation-modeling/)) etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "DSSM can be used to develop latent semantic models that project entities of different types (e.g., queries and documents) into a common low-dimensional semantic space for a variety of machine learning tasks such as ranking and classification. For example, in web search ranking, the relevance of a document given a query can be readily computed as the distance between them in that space. With the latest GPUs from Nvidia, we can train our models on billions of words. Readers that are interested in deep learning for text processing may refer to the tutorial by [He et al., 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/deep-learning-for-natural-language-processing-theory-and-practice-tutorial/).\n",
    "We released the predictors and trained model files of the DSSM (also a.k.a. Sent2Vec).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop mechanism such that given a pair of documents say a query and a set of web page documents, the model would map the inputs to a pair of feature vectors in a continuous, low dimensional space where one could compare the semantic similarity between the text strings using the cosine similarity between their vectors in that space.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://kubicode.me/img/Study-With-Deep-Structured-Semantic-Model/dssm_arch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure above one can see how given a query ($Q$) and set of documents ($D_1, D_2, \\ldots, D_n$), one can generate latent representation a.k.a. semantic features, which can then be used to generate pairwise distance metric. The metric evaluated can be used for ranking."

    "In the picture above, one can see that the query and the document are each mapped to a term vector. While a [bag of word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) based modeling is a first step one takes while building NLP models, they are limited in their ability to capture relative positions amongst words. Convolution based, or recurrence based models perform better due to their inherent ability to leverage the positions of words. In this tutorial, we will use a simple illustrative model using LSTM to encode the term vector following the work done by [Palangi et. al.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/LSTM_DSSM_IEEE_TASLP.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we show you how to build such a network.  We use a small sample from the Question-Answering corpus. Additionally we will use a recurrent network to develop the semantic model as it allows to inherently incorporate the positional information with the word tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The data set is very small and the emphasis of this tutorial is in showing how to create an end-to-end modeling workflow for the DSSM network and not so much on the specific numerical performance we are able to get on this small data set. "

    "The use cases of DSSM often appear in information retrieval where for a given query or question there are few answers amongst an ocean of poor or non-answers. The input data as in this case is a pair of query and answer (document or advertisement) that attracted a click. A classical way to train would be a a binary classifier to predict click / no-click (or equivalently a 2-class classifier - one class each for click or no click). One could generate pairs of query and incorrect answers (as no-click data). However, one way to simulate no-click data is to use query and answers for other queries within a minibatch. This is the concept behind `cosine_distance_with_negative_samples` function. Note: This function returns 1 for correct the question and answer pair and 0 for incorrect, which is referred to as *similarity*. Hence, we use 1- `cosine_distance_with_negative_samples` as our loss function."
