    "# CNTK 203: Reinforcement Learning Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning inspired by behaviorist psychology, concerned with how [software agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent) ought to take [actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_selection) in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. In machine learning, the environment is typically formulated as a [Markov decision process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process) (MDP) as many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context utilize [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some machine learning settings, we do not have immediate access to labels, so we cannot rely on supervised learning techniques. If, however, there is something we can interact with and thereby get some feedback that tells us occasionally, whether our previous behavior was good or not, we can use RL to learn how to improve our behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in supervised learning, in RL, labeled correct input/output pairs are never presented and sub-optimal actions are never explicitly corrected. This mimics many of the online learning paradigms which involves finding a balance between exploration (of conditions or actions never learnt before) and exploitation (of already learnt conditions or actions from previous encounters). Multi-arm bandit problems is one of the category of RL algorithms where exploration vs. exploitation trade-off have been thoroughly studied. See figure below for [reference](http://www.simongrant.org/pubs/thesis/3/2.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cntk.ai/jup/polecart.gif\", width=300, height=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the [CartPole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0) environment from OpenAI's [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) simulator to teach a cart to balance a pole. As described in the link above, in the CartPole example, a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The system is controlled by applying a force of +1 or -1 to the cart. A reward of +1 is provided for every timestep that the pole remains upright. The episode ends when the pole is more than 15 degrees from vertical, or the cart moves more than 2.4 units from the center. See figure below for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**\n",
    "Our goal is to prevent the pole from falling over as the cart moves with the pole in upright position (perpendicular to the cart) as the starting state. More specifically if the pole is less than 15 degrees from vertical while the cart is within 2.4 units of the center we will collect reward. In this tutorial, we will train till we learn a set of actions (policies) that lead to an average reward of 200 or more over last 50 batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In, RL terminology, the goal is to find _policies_ $a$, that maximize the _reward_ $r$ (feedback) through interaction with some environment (in this case the pole being balanced on the cart). So given a series of experiences $$s \\xrightarrow{a} r, s'$$ we then can learn how to choose action $a$ in a given state $s$ to maximize the accumulated reward $r$ over time:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "Q(s,a) &= r_0 + \\gamma r_1 + \\gamma^2 r_2 + \\ldots \\newline\n",
    "&= r_0 + \\gamma \\max_a Q^*(s',a)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\gamma \\in [0,1)$ is the discount factor that controls how much we should value reward that is further away. This is called the [*Bellmann*-equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will show how to model the state space, how to use the received reward to figure out which action yields the highest future reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "We present two different popular approaches here:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Q-Networks**: DQNs have become famous in 2015 when they were successfully used to train how to play Atari just form raw pixels. We train neural network to learn the $Q(s,a)$ values (thus _Q-Network _). From these $Q$ functions values we choose the best action.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy gradient**: This method directly estimates the policy (set of actions) in the network. The outcome is a learning of an ordered set of actions which leads to maximize reward by probabilistically choosing a subset of actions. In this tutorial, we learn the actions using a gradient descent approach to learn the policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we focus how to implement RL in CNTK. We choose a straight forward shallow network. One can extend the approaches by replacing our shallow model with deeper networks that are introduced in other CNTK tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this tutorial is in its early stages and will be evolving in future updates."
