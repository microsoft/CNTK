    "So let us dive right in. Below we will introduce CNTK's data model and CNTK's programming model--*networks are function objects*  (i.e. a network can be called like a function, and it also holds some state, the weights, or parameters, that get adjusted during learning). We will put that into action for logistic regression and MNIST digit recognition,\n",
    "using CNTK's Functional API. Lastly, CNTK also has a lower-level graph API. We will replicate one example with it.\n",

    "to apply it to data.\n",
    "On the other hand, a neural network contains learnable parameters\n",

    "This graph structure is wrapped in the Python class `Function` that exposes the necessary interface so that other Python functions can call it and access its members (such as `W` and `b`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function object is CNTK's single abstraction used to represent different operations, which\n",
    "are only distinguished by convention:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **basic operations** without learnable parameters (e.g. `+`, `*`, `sigmoid()`...)\n",
    " * **layers** (`Dense()`, `Embedding()`, `Convolution()`...). Layers map one input to one output and may have learnable parameters attached to them.\n",
    " * **recurrent step functions** (`LSTM()`, `GRU()`, `RNNStep()`). Step functions map a previous state and a new input to a new state.\n",
    " * **loss and metric** functions (`cross_entropy_with_softmax()`, `binary_cross_entropy()`, `squared_error()`, `classification_error()`...).\n",
    "   In CNTK, losses and metric are not particularly special, they are just functions. The only difference is that while a CNTK function can have one or multiple outputs, a loss and metric must have a single output. Note that a loss does not have to output a scalar value: If the output of a loss is not scalar, CNTK will automatically define the loss as the sum of the outputs. This behavior can be overriden by explicitly performing a reduction operation by yourself.   \n",
    " * **models**. Models are defined by the user. A model maps features to predictions or scores, and is what gets deployed in the end.\n",
    " * **criterion function**. The criterion function maps (features, labels) to a loss and optionally a metric.\n",
    "   The Trainer optimizes the loss by SGD, and logs the metric. The metric may be non-differentiable, but the loss must be differentiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher-order layers compose objects into more complex ones, including:\n",
    "\n",
    " * layer **stacking** (`Sequential()`, `For()`)\n",
    " * **recurrence** (`Recurrence()`, `Fold()`, `UnfoldFrom()`, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Networks are commonly defined by using existing CNTK functions (such as\n",
    "specific types of neural-network layers)\n",
    "and composing them using `Sequential()`.\n",
    "In addition, users can write their own functions\n",
    "as arbitrary Python expressions, as long as those consist of CNTK operations\n",
    "over CNTK data types.\n",
    "Python expressions get converted into the internal representation by wrapping them in a call to\n",
    "`Function()`. Expressions can be written as multi-line functions through decorator syntax (`@Function`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if an operation cannot be expressed by combining CNTK's primitives, there are mechanisms\n",
    "for [extending CNTK](https://www.cntk.ai/pythondocs/extend.html) by writing your own \"layer\"\n",
    "in Python (or in C++). This is advanced functionality, that you shouldn't worry about now,\n",
    "but it's good to know about it in case you ever need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, CNTK function objects enable easy parameter sharing. If you call the same\n",
    "function object at multiple places, all invocations will naturally share the same learnable parameters.\n",
    "To avoid sharing parameters, you simply create two different function objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the function object is CNTK's single abstraction for conveniently defining\n",
    "simple and complex models, parameter sharing, and training objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to define CNTK networks directly in terms of its underlying graph operations, similar to many other toolkits. And you can freely *mix and match* between the two styles of defining your neural network. This is discussed further below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CNTK's Data model: Sequences of Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "CNTK can operate on two types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **tensors** (that is, N-dimensional arrays), dense or sparse\n",
    " * **sequences** of tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction is that the shape of a tensor is static during operation,\n",
    "while the length of a sequence depends on data.\n",
    "In CNTK we use axes to mean the same thing as dimensions for numpy arrays, \n",
    "i.e. a tensor of shape (7,10,6) has three *axes*.\n",
    "Tensors have *static axes*, while a sequence has an additional *dynamic axis*.\n",
    "A dynamic axis, is therefore a variable length axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical data is represented as sparse one-hot tensors \n",
    "(i.e. having all elements 0 except a single 1 at the position of the category it encodes).\n",
    "This allows to write embeddings and loss functions in a unified fashion as matrix products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Printing a CNTK function will give you an output similar to the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Operation*(Sequence[Tensor[*shape*]], *other arguments*) -> Tensor[*shape*]\n",
    "\n",
    "When the *Operation* is `Composite` the function is representing the whole graph underneath it and what's shown is just the last operation. This graph has a certain number of inputs that expect particular types of inputs. When you print a function you will note **the absence of a batch dimension**. CNTK hides batching from the user. We want users to think in tensors and sequences, and leave mini-batching to CNTK. Unlike other toolkits, CNTK can also automatically batch sequences with different lengths into one minibatch, and handles all necessary padding and packing. Workarounds like 'bucketing' are not needed. The reason we are separatring the dynamic axes (batch and sequence) from the static axes is because there are only very few operations that affect these axes. By default you want to do something to every example in the batch and every element of a sequence. Only few special operations (such as recurrence, or batch normalization), need to deal with these axes."

    "## Feeding Your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have decided your model structure and defined it, you are facing the question on feeding\n",
    "your training data to the CNTK training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above examples simply feed the data as numpy/scipy arrays.\n",
    "That is only one of three ways CNTK provides for feeding data to the trainer:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. As **numpy arrays** or **scipy sparse (CSR) matrices**, for small data sets that can just be loaded into RAM.\n",
    " 2. Through instances of **CNTK's MinibatchSource class**, for large data sets that do not fit into RAM.\n",
    " 3. Through an **explicit minibatch-loop** when the above do not apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Feeding Data Via Numpy/Scipy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The `train()` and `test()` functions accept a tuple of numpy arrays or scipy sparse matrices (in CSR format) for their `minibatch_source` arguments.\n",
    "The tuple members must be in the same order as the arguments of the `criterion` function that `train()` or `test()` are called on.\n",
    "For dense tensors, use numpy arrays, while sparse data should have the type `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the arguments should be a Python list of numpy/scipy arrays, where each list entry represents a data item. For arguments declared as a sequence, the first axis (dimension) of the numpy/scipy array is the sequence length, while the remaining axes are the shape of each element of the sequence. Arguments that are not sequences consist of a single tensor. The shapes, data types (`np.float32/float64`) and sparseness must match the argument types.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an optimization, arguments that are not sequences can also be passed as a single large numpy/scipy array (instead of a list). This is what is done in the examples above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is the responsibility of the user to randomize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Feeding Data Using the `MinibatchSource` class for Reading Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Production-scale training data sometimes does not fit into RAM. For this case, CNTK provides the `MinibatchSource` class, which provides:\n",
    "\n",
    " * A **chunked randomization algorithm** that holds only part of the data in RAM at any given time.\n",
    " * **Distributed reading** where each worker reads a different subset.\n",
    " * A **transformation pipeline** for images and image augmentation.\n",
    " * **Composability** across multiple data types (e.g. image captioning).\n",
    " * Transparent **asynchronous loading** so that the GPU is not stalling while a minibatch is read/prepared \n",
    "\n",
    "At present, the `MinibatchSource` class implements a limited set of data types in the form of \"deserializers\":\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Images** (`ImageDeserializer`).\n",
    " * **Speech files** (`HTKFeatureDeserializer`, `HTKMLFDeserializer`).\n",
    " * Data in CNTK's **canonical text format (CTF)**, which consists of a set of named feature channels each containing a one dimensional sparse or dense sequence per example. The CTFDeserializer can then associates each feature channel with an input of your model or criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example of using the `ImageDeserializer` class shows the general pattern.\n",
    "For the specific input-file formats, please consult the documentation\n",
    "or data-type specific tutorials such as Tutorial 202."

    "## Training and Evaluating\n",
    "\n",
    "In our examples above, we use the `train()` function to train, and `test()` for evaluating.\n",
    "In this section, we want to walk you through the advanced options of `train()`:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Distributed Training** on multiple GPUs using MPI.\n",
    " 2. Callbacks for **Progress Tracking**, **TensorBoard visualization**, **Checkpointing**,**Cross-validation**-based training control, and **Testing** for the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Distributed Training\n",
    "\n",
    "CNTK makes distributed training easy. Out of the box, it supports three methods of distributed training:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Simple **data-parallel** training.\n",
    " * **1-bit SGD**.\n",
    " * **BlockMomentum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple **data-parallel** training distributes each minibatch over N worker processes, where each process utilizes one GPU.\n",
    "After each minibatch, the gradients from all workers are aggregated before updating each model copy.\n",
    "This is often sufficient for convolutional networks, which have a high computation/communication ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1-bit SGD** uses the techniques from [this paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/1-bit-stochastic-gradient-descent-and-application-to-data-parallel-distributed-training-of-speech-dnns/) to speed up the communication step in data-parallel training. This method has been found effective for networks where communication cost becomes the dominating factor, such as full-connected networks and some recurrent ones. This method has been found to only minimally degrade accuracy at good speed-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BlockMomentum** uses the techniques from [this paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/scalable-training-deep-learning-machines-incremental-block-training-intra-block-parallel-optimization-blockwise-model-update-filtering/) to improvs communication bandwidth by exchanging gradients only every N minibatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processes are started with and communicate through MPI. Hence, CNTK's distributed training\n",
    "works both within a single server and across multiple servers.\n",
    "All you need to do is\n",
    "\n",
    " * wrap your learner inside a `distributed_learner` object\n",
    " * execute the Python script using `mpiexec`\n",
    " \n",
    "Unfortunately, MPI cannot be used from a Jupyter notebook. You can find the example below\n",
    "as a standalone Python script under `Examples/1stSteps/MNIST_Complex_Training.py` to run under MPI, for example under MSMPI as\n",

    "### 2. Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "The `callbacks` parameter of `train()` specifies actions that the `train()` function\n",
    "executes periodically, typically every epoch.\n",
    "The `callbacks` parameter is a list of objects, where the object type decides the specific callback action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Progress trackers allow to log progress (average loss and metric)\n",
    "periodically after N minibatches and after completing each epoch.\n",
    "Optionally, all of the first few minibatches can be logged.\n",
    "The `ProgressPrinter` callback logs to stderr and file, while `TensorBoardProgressWriter`\n",
    "logs events for visualization in TensorBoard.\n",
    "You can also write your own progress tracker class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the `CheckpointConfig` class denotes a callback that writes a checkpoint file every epoch, and automatically restarts training at the latest available checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CrossValidationConfig` class tells CNTK to periodically evaluate the model on a validation data set,\n",
    "and then call a user-specified callback function, which can then update the learning rate of return `False` to indicate early stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, `TestConfig` instructs CNTK to evaluate the model at the end on a given test set.\n",
    "This is the same as the explicit `test()` call in our examples above."
