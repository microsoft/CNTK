    "For classification and prediction problems a typical criterion function is cross-entropy with softmax. If the number of output classes is high the computation of this criterion and the corresponding gradients could be quite costly. Sampled Softmax is a heuristic to speed up training in these cases.

    "## Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The softmax function is used in neural networks if we want to interpret the network output as a probability distribution over a set of classes $C$ with $|C|=N_C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax maps an $N_C$-dimensional vector $z$, which has unrestricted values, to an $N_C$ dimensional vector $p$ with non-negative values that sum up to 1 so that they can be interpreted as probabilities. More precisely:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "p_i &= softmax(z, i)\\\\\n",
    "    &= \\frac{exp(z_i)}{\\sum_{k\\in C} exp(z_k)}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows we assume that the input $z$ to the softmax is computed from some hidden vector $h$ of dimension $N_h$  in a specific way, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = W h + b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W$ is a learnable weight matrix of dimension $(N_c, N_h)$ and $b$ is a learnable bias vector.\n",
    "We restrict ourselves to this specific choice of $z$ because it helps in implementing an efficient sampled softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical use-case like for example a recurrent language model, the hidden vector $h$ would be the output of the recurrent layers and $C$ would be the set of words to predict.   \n",
    "\n",
    "As a training criterion, we use cross-entropy which is a function of the expected (true) class $t\\in C$ and the probability predicted for it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$cross\\_entropy := -log(p_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sampled Softmax from the outside\n",
    "\n",
    "For the normal softmax the CNTK Python-api provides the function [cross_entropy_with_softmax](https://cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.ops.html?highlight=softmax#cntk.ops.cross_entropy_with_softmax). This takes as input the $N_C$-dimensional vector $z$. As mentioned for our sampled softmax implementation we assume that this z is computed by $ z = W h + b $. In sampled softmax this has to be part of the whole implementation of the criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we show the code for `cross_entropy_with_sampled_softmax_and_embedding`. Let’s look at the signature first.\n",
    "\n",
    "One fundamental difference to the corresponding function in the Python-api (`cross_entropy_with_softmax`) is that in the Python api function the input corresponds to $z$ and must have the same dimension as the target vector, while in cross_entropy_with_full_softmax the input corresponds to our hidden vector $h$ can have any dimension (hidden_dim).\n",
    "Actually, hidden_dim will be typically much lower than the dimension of the target vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have some additional parameters `num_samples, sampling_weights, allow_duplicates` that control the random sampling. \n",
    "Another difference to the api function is that we return a triple (z, cross_entropy_on_samples, error_on_samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will come back to the details of the implementation below."

    "In the above code we use two different methods to report training progress:\n",
    "1. Using a function that computes the average cross entropy on full softmax.\n",
    "2. Using the built-in ProgressPrinter\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In such cases one often uses a non uniform distribution for drawing the samples in sampled softmax but instead increases the sampling weight for the frequent classes. This is also called importane sampling.\n",
    "In our example the sampling distribution is controlled by the weight array `softmax_sampling_weights`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example let's look at the case where the classes are distrubted according to zipf-distrubtion like:\n",
    "$$\n",
