The `sgd` optimizer would calculate the `loss` or error between the predicted label against the corresponding ground-truth label and using [gradient-decent](http://www.statisticsviews.com/details/feature/5722691/Getting-to-the-Bottom-of-Regression-with-Gradient-Descent.html) generate a new set model parameters in a single iteration. \n",

However, the updates generated using a single observation sample at a time can vary wildly between iterations. An intermediate ground is to load a small set of observations and use an average of the `loss` or error from that set to update the model parameters. This subset is called a *minibatch*.\n",
