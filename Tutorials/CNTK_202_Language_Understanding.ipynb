And in the same way that it is convenient to have names for arguments when you write a regular function in a programming language, it is convenient to have placeholders that refer to arguments (or local computations that need to be reused). Eventually, some other code will replace these placeholders with other known quantities in the same way that in a programming language the function will be called with concrete values bound to its arguments. \n",

In the case where such instantiations are challenging or not possible, using `placeholder` is a logical choice. Having the `placeholder` only allows you to defer the specification of the argument at a later time when you may have the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Aha, knowledge of future words help. So instead of a one-word lookahead,\n",
    "why not look ahead until all the way to the end of the sentence, through a backward recurrence?\n",
    "Let us create a bidirectional model!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement a new layer that\n",
    "performs both a forward and a backward recursion over the data, and\n",
    "concatenates the output vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that this differs from the previous task in that\n",
    "the bidirectional layer contains learnable model parameters.\n",
    "In function-composition style,\n",
    "the pattern to implement a layer with model parameters is to write a *factory function*\n",
    "that creates a *function object*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function object, also known as [*functor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_object), is an object that is both a function and an object.\n",
    "Which means nothing else that it contains data yet still can be invoked as if it was a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `Dense(outDim)` is a factory function that returns a function object that contains\n",
    "a weight matrix `W`, a bias `b`, and another function to compute \n",
    "`input @ W + b.` (This is using \n",
    "[Python 3.5 notation for matrix multiplication](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html#whatsnew-pep-465).\n",
    "In Numpy syntax it is `input.dot(W) + b`).\n",
    "E.g. saying `Dense(1024)` will create this function object, which can then be used\n",
    "like any other function, also immediately: `Dense(1024)(x)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example for further clarity: Let us implement a new layer that combines\n",
    "a linear layer with a subsequent batch normalization. \n",
    "To allow function composition, the layer needs to be realized as a factory function,\n",
    "which could look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def DenseLayerWithBN(dim):\n",
    "    F = Dense(dim)\n",
    "    G = BatchNormalization()\n",
    "    x = placeholder()\n",
    "    apply_x = G(F(x))\n",
    "    return apply_x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Invoking this factory function will create `F`, `G`, `x`, and `apply_x`. In this example, `F` and `G` are function objects themselves, and `apply_x` is the function to be applied to the data.\n",
    "Thus, e.g. calling `DenseLayerWithBN(1024)` will\n",
    "create an object containing a linear-layer function object called `F`, a batch-normalization function object `G`,\n",
    "and `apply_x` which is the function that implements the actual operation of this layer\n",
    "using `F` and `G`. It will then return `apply_x`. To the outside, `apply_x` looks and behaves\n",
    "like a function. Under the hood, however, `apply_x` retains access to its specific instances of `F` and `G`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now back to our task at hand. You will now need to create a factory function,\n",
    "very much like the example above.\n",
    "You shall create a factory function\n",
    "that creates two recurrent layer instances (one forward, one backward), and then defines an `apply_x` function\n",
    "which applies both layer instances to the same `x` and concatenate the two results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, give it a try! To know how to realize a backward recursion in CNTK,\n",
    "please take a hint from how the forward recursion is done.\n",
    "Please also do the following:\n",
    "* remove the one-word lookahead you added in the previous task, which we aim to replace; and\n",
    "* make sure each LSTM is using `hidden_dim//2` outputs to keep the total number of model parameters limited."
