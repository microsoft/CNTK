    "# CNTK 103: Part D - Convolutional Neural Network with MNIST\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that you have successfully completed CNTK 103 Part A (MNIST Data Loader).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on MNIST data. This notebook provides the recipe using the Python API. If you are looking for this example in BrainScript, please look [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/2.5.1/Examples/Image/GettingStarted)\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN, or ConvNet) is a type of [feed-forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network) artificial neural network made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases, very similar to ordinary multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks introduced in 103C. The CNNs take advantage of the spatial nature of the data. In nature, we perceive different objects by their shapes, size and colors. For example, objects in a natural scene are typically edges, corners/vertices (defined by two of more edges), color patches etc. These primitives are often identified using different detectors (e.g., edge detection, color detector) or combination of detectors interacting to facilitate image interpretation (object classification, region of interest detection, scene description etc.) in real world vision related tasks. These detectors are also known as filters. Convolution is a mathematical operator that takes an image and a filter as input and produces a filtered output (representing say egdges, corners, colors etc in the input image).  Historically, these filters are a set of weights that were often hand crafted or modeled with mathematical functions (e.g., [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_filter) / [Laplacian](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/log.htm) / [Canny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector) filter).  The filter outputs are mapped through non-linear activation functions mimicking human brain cells called [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron).\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional networks provide a machinery to learn these filters from the data directly instead of explicit mathematical models and have been found to be superior (in real world tasks) compared to historically crafted filters.  With convolutional networks, the focus is on learning the filter weights instead of learning individually fully connected pair-wise (between inputs and outputs) weights. In this way, the number of weights to learn is reduced when compared with the traditional MLP networks from the previous tutorials.  In a convolutional network, one learns several filters ranging from few single digits to few thousands depending on the network complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the CNN primitives have been shown to have a conceptually parallel components in brain's [visual cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex). The group of neurons cells in visual cortex emit responses when stimulated. This region is known as the receptive field (RF). Equivalently, in convolution the input region corresponding to the filter dimensions can be considered as the receptive field. Popular deep CNNs or ConvNets (such as [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet), [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556), [Inception](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Szegedy_Going_Deeper_With_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf), [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1.pdf)) that are used for various [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) tasks have many of these architectural primitives (inspired from biology).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will introduce the convolution operation and gain familiarity with the different parameters in CNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**:\n",
    "As in CNTK 103C, we will continue to work on the same problem of recognizing digits in MNIST data. The MNIST data comprises of hand-written digits with little background noise."

In MLP, all possible pairs of input pixels are connected to the output nodes with each pair having a weight, thus leading to a combinatorial explosion of parameters to be learnt and also increasing the possibility of overfitting ([details](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/)). Convolution layers take advantage of the spatial arrangement of the pixels and learn multiple filters that significantly reduce the amount of parameters in the network ([details](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)).

    "\n",
    "Often a times, one needs to control the number of parameters especially when having deep networks. For every layer of the convolution layer output (each layer, corresponds to the output of a filter), one can have a pooling layer. Pooling layers are typically introduced to:\n",
    "- Reduce the dimensionality of the previous layer (speeding up the network),\n",
    "- Makes the model more tolerant to changes in object location in the image. For example, even when a digit is shifted to one side of the image instead of being in the middle, the classifer would perform the classification task well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation on a pooling node is much simpler than a normal feedforward node.  It has no weight, bias, or activation function.  It uses a simple aggregation function (like max or average) to compute its output.  The most commonly used function is \"max\" - a max pooling node simply outputs the maximum of the input values corresponding to the filter position of the input. The figure below shows the input values in a 4 x 4 region. The max pooling window size is 2 x 2 and starts from the top left corner. The maximum value within the window becomes the output of the region. Every time the model is shifted by the amount specified by the stride parameter (as shown in the figure below) and the maximum pooling operation is repeated. \n",
