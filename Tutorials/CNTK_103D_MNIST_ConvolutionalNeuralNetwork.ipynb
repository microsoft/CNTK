    "In this tutorial we will train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on MNIST data. This notebook provides the recipe using Python APIs. If you are looking for this example in BrainScript, please look [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/v2.0.rc2/Examples/Image/GettingStarted)\n",

    "As summarized in Wikipedia, a [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN, or ConvNet) is a type of [feed-forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network) artificial neural network in which the connectivity pattern between its neurons is inspired by the organization of animal [visual cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex) (such as [Hubel and Wiesel model](http://knowingneurons.com/2014/10/29/hubel-and-wiesel-the-neural-basis-of-visual-perception/)) of the brain's visual cortex. The cells in visual cortex emit responses when stimulated. This region is known as the **receptive fields (RF)**, where each receptive-field overlapping with one another come together to generate the visual field (or image). This model views the mammalian visual cortex as a set of hierarchical layers, each consisting of simple cells that extract features from a localized area and complex cells that take their input from multiple simple cells. Popular deep CNNs or ConvNets (such as [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet), [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556), [Inception](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Szegedy_Going_Deeper_With_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf), [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1.pdf)) that are used for various [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) tasks have many of these architectural primitives (inspired from biology). \n",
    "\n",
    "The [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)) operation closely approximates how we see and visually interpret the world around us. The convolution networks (a variation of the MLP network) are optimized feed-forward operations. In this tutorial, we will introduce the convolution operation and gain familiarity with the different parameters in CNNs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**:\n",
    "As in CNTK 103C, we will continue to work on the same problem of recognizing digits in MNIST data. The MNIST data comprises of hand-written digits with little background noise."

    "CNN is a feedforward network made up of bunch of layers in such a way that the output of one layer becomes the input to the next layer (similar to MLP). In MLP, all possible pairs of input pixels are connected to the output nodes with each pair having a weight, thus leading to an explosion of parameters to be learnt and also increasing the possibility of overfitting ([details](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/). Convolution layers take advantage of the spatial arrangement of the pixels and learn multiple filters that significantly reduce the amount of parameters in the network(for [details](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)). The size of the filter is a parameter of the convolution layer and it spatial dimension corresponds to the receptive field (image pixels) in the input image (as explained below).  \n",

    "   \n",
    "   2. Instead of having a single set of weights (as in a Dense layer), convolutional layers have multiple sets (shown in figure with multiple colors), called **filters**. Each filter detects features within each possible RF in the input image.  The output of the convolution is a set of `n` sub-layers (shown in the animation below) where `n` is the number of filters (refer to the above figure).    \n",
    "     \n",

This reduces the number of parameters to be learnt and thus overfitting. This also opens the door for several aspects of deep learning which has enabled very practical solutions to be built:\n",
