      "[1] Doc: ( @entity0 ) -- if you think comic book characters do amazing things in comic books , you wo n't believe what they can do off the page . for starters , @entity8 brought down the @entity10 , and @entity11 raised ships from the ocean floor . 1 . superman defeats the @entity10 in the 1940s , \" @entity17 \" was a radio sensation . kids across the country huddled around their sets as the @entity21 leapt off the page and over the airwaves . although @entity8 had been fighting crime in print since 1938 , the weekly audio episodes fleshed out his storyline even further . it was on the radio that @entity8 first faced kryptonite , met @entity32 reporter @entity31 , and became associated with \" truth , justice , and the @entity36 way . \" so , it 's no wonder that when a young writer and activist named @entity41 decided to expose the secrets of the @entity10 , he looked to a certain superhero for inspiration . in the @entity46 era , the @entity10 experienced a huge resurgence . its membership was skyrocketing , and its political influence was increasing , so @entity41 went undercover to infiltrate the group . by regularly attending meetings , he became privy to the organization 's secrets . but when he took the information to local authorities , they had little interest in using it . the @entity10 had become so powerful and intimidating that police were hesitant to build a case against them . struggling to make use of his findings , @entity41 approached the writers of the @entity8 radio serial . it was perfect timing . with the war over and the @entity70 no longer a threat , the producers were looking for a new villain for @entity8 to fight . the @entity10 was a great fit for the role . in a 16 - episode series titled \" @entity76 , \" the writers pitted the @entity21 against the men in white hoods . as the storyline progressed , the shows exposed many of the @entity10 's most guarded secrets . by revealing everything from code words to rituals , the program completely stripped the @entity10 of its mystique . within two weeks of the broadcast , @entity10 recruitment was down . and by 1948 , people were showing up to klan rallies just to mock them . @entity0 : 5 memorable moments in comic book censorship 2 . @entity11 's scientific breakthrough in 1966 , @entity97 engineer @entity96 developed a method for raising sunken ships off the ocean floor by injecting them with polystyrene foam balls . however , when @entity96 tried to license his invention with the @entity105 patent office , he was denied . @entity11 had beaten him to the punch by 22 years . indeed , @entity108 's concept could be traced back to a @entity11 comic conceived by @entity110 . in addition to being the most celebrated artist of the @entity11 comics , @entity110 was known for his scientific prowess . so in a 1944 story , when @entity11 got a bump on his head that turned him into a genius , the duck managed to mumble , \" if i mix @entity120 [ a methylene compound ] with @entity122 [ ammonium ] and boil the atoms in osmotic fog , i should get speckled nitrogen ! \" although it sounded like nonsense , it was n't . in 1963 , chemists @entity130 and @entity132 wrote a technical article about methylene that included a reference to the @entity11 story . the final paragraph read , \" among experiments which have not , to our knowledge , been carried out as yet is one of a most intriguing nature suggested in the literature of no less than 19 years ago . \" a footnote revealed that \" literature \" as the @entity11 comic . it seems the web - footed children 's hero had deduced the chemical intermediate long before it had been proven to exist . @entity0 : musicians performing on @entity152 but why were these top @entity36 chemists looking to comics for inspiration ? apparently , dr. @entity130 had been a lifelong @entity11 fan , and he 'd rediscovered @entity11 's early reference to methylene while collecting old copies of the classic adventures . @entity130 never disclosed how much his work owed to @entity162 's most famous resident , but then again , how many scientists would confess that they used comic books to bolster their research ? 3 . a @entity166 villain keeps folks out of jail in a 1977 edition of @entity166 , @entity169 has the tables turned on him . the villain , @entity172 , tracks down @entity169 using an electronic transmitter that he 'd fastened to the superhero 's wrist . although @entity172 loses in the end ( he always does ) , one @entity177 judge saw beauty in his plan . inspired by the strip , judge @entity181 turned to computer salesman @entity183 and asked if he could create a similar device to keep track of crime suspects awaiting trial . in 1983 , @entity183 produced his first batch of electronic monitors . authorities in @entity191 then tested the devices on five offenders , using the gadgets as an alternative to incarceration . today , the transmitters are a common sight in courtrooms across the country , usually in the form of electronic ankle bracelets . most famously , @entity203 donned one while she was under house arrest in 2004 . perhaps she would have felt better knowing that the gadget had once nabbed @entity166 , too . @entity0 : truth about lie detectors ( and @entity208 ) 4 . @entity209 saves the bad - hair day like most @entity36 kids in the 1940s , @entity211 fantasized about growing up to be like his favorite comic book superheroes . but it turns out that @entity216 might have been more interested in their fashion statements than their special powers . during his early teen years , @entity211 was obsessed with @entity209 , known as \" @entity36 's most famous boy hero . \" a younger version of @entity224 , the character sported an unusual hairstyle that featured a curly tuft of hair falling over the side of his forehead . sound familiar ? when @entity211 set out to conquer @entity36 with his rock ' n ' roll ways , he copied the ' do , thus making it one of the most famous hairstyles of the 20th century . but that was n't all . @entity224 also gets credit for the short capes @entity211 wore on the back of his jumpsuits , as well as @entity216 's famous @entity243 logo , which bears a striking resemblance to @entity224 's lightning bolt insignia . of course , @entity211 never tried to hide his love for the captain . a copy of @entity209 no. 51 still sits in his preserved childhood bedroom in an apartment in @entity251 , and his full comics collection remains intact in the attic at @entity254 . plus , the admiration was mutual . @entity209 paid tribute to @entity216 in one issue , referring to the singer as \" the greatest modern - day philosopher . \" for more mental_floss articles , visit @entity261 entire contents of this article copyright , @entity263 rights reserved .\n",
