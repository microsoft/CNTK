    "The trainer strives to reduce the `loss` function by different optimization approaches, [Stochastic Gradient Descent][] (`sgd`) being one of the most popular one. Typically, one would start with random initialization of the model parameters. The `sgd` optimizer would calculate the `loss` or error between the predicted label against the corresponding ground-truth label and using [gradient-decent][] generate a new set model parameters in a single iteration. \n",

However, the updates generated using a single observation sample at a time can vary wildly between iterations. An intermediate ground is to load a small set of observations and use an average of the `loss` or error from that set to update the model parameters. This subset is called a *minibatch*.\n",

    "With minibatches we often sample observation from the larger training dataset. We repeat the process of model parameters update using different combination of training samples and over a period of time minimize the `loss` (and the error). When the incremental error rates are no longer changing significantly or after a preset number of maximum minibatches to train, we claim that our model is trained.\n",
