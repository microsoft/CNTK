    "The trainer strives to reduce the `loss` function by different optimization approaches, [Stochastic Gradient Descent][] (`sgd`) being one of the most popular one. Typically, one would start with random initialization of the model parameters. The `sgd` optimizer would calculate the `loss` or error between the predicted label against the corresponding ground-truth label and using [gradient-decent][] generate a new set model parameters in a single iteration. \n",

    "The aforementioned model parameter update using a single observation at a time is attractive since it does not require the entire data set (all observation) to be loaded in memory and also requires gradient computation over fewer datapoints, thus allowing for training on large data sets. However, the updates generated using a single observation sample at a time can vary wildly between iterations. An intermediate ground is to load a small set of observations and use an average of the `loss` or error from that set to update the model parameters. This subset is called a *minibatch*.\n",
    "\n",
    "With minibatches we often sample observation from the larger training dataset. We repeat the process of model parameters update using different combination of training samples and over a period of time minimize the `loss` (and the error). When the incremental error rates are no longer changing significantly or after a preset number of maximum minibatches to train, we claim that our model is trained.\n",
