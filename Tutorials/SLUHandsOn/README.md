# CNTK Tuturial: Language Understanding

## Overview

This hands-on lab shows how to implement a recurrent network to process text, for the Air Travel Information Services (ATIS) tasks of slot tagging and intent classification. We will start with a straight-forward embedding followed by a recurrent LSTM. We will then extend it to include neighbor words and run bidirectionally. Lastly, we will turn this system into an intent classifier.
