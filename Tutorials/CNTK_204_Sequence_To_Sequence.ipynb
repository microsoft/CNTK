    "\n",
    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on tutorial will take you through both the basics of sequence-to-sequence networks, and how to implement them in the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit. In particular, we will implement a sequence-to-sequence model to perform grapheme to phoneme translation. We will start with some basic theory and then explain the data in more detail, and how you can download it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Andrej Karpathy has a [nice visualization](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) of the five paradigms of neural network architectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=http://cntk.ai/jup/paradigms.jpg width=750px>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to be talking about the fourth paradigm: many-to-many, also known as sequence-to-sequence networks. The input is a sequence with a dynamic length, and the output is also a sequence with some dynamic length. It is the logical extension of the many-to-one paradigm in that previously we were predicting some category (which could easily be one of `V` words where `V` is an entire vocabulary) and now we want to predict a whole sequence of those categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The applications of sequence-to-sequence networks are nearly limitless. It is a natural fit for machine translation (e.g. English input sequences, French output sequences); automatic text summarization (e.g. full document input sequence, summary output sequence); word to pronunciation models (e.g. character [grapheme] input sequence, pronunciation [phoneme] output sequence); and even parse tree generation (e.g. regular text input, flat parse tree output).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic theory\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence-to-sequence model consists of two main pieces: (1) an encoder; and (2) a decoder. Both the encoder and the decoder are recurrent neural network (RNN) layers that can be implemented using a vanilla RNN, an LSTM, or GRU cells (here we will use LSTM). In the basic sequence-to-sequence model, the encoder processes the input sequence into a fixed representation that is fed into the decoder as a context. The decoder then uses some mechanism (discussed below) to decode the processed information into an output sequence. The decoder is a language model that is augmented with some \"strong context\" by the encoder, and so each symbol that it generates is fed back into the decoder for additional context (like a traditional LM). For an English to German translation task, the most basic setup might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=http://cntk.ai/jup/s2s.png width=700px>\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic sequence-to-sequence network passes the information from the encoder to the decoder by initializing the decoder RNN with the final hidden state of the encoder as its initial hidden state. The input is then a \"sequence start\" tag (`<s>` in the diagram above) which primes the decoder to start generating an output sequence. Then, whatever word (or note or image, etc.) it generates at that step is fed in as the input for the next step. The decoder keeps generating outputs until it hits the special \"end sequence\" tag (`</s>` above).\n",
    "\n",
    "A more complex and powerful version of the basic sequence-to-sequence network uses an attention model. While the above setup works well, it can start to break down when the input sequences get long. At each step, the hidden state `h` is getting updated with the most recent information, and therefore `h` might be getting \"diluted\" in information as it processes each token. Further, even with a relatively short sequence, the last token will always get the last say and therefore the thought vector will be somewhat biased/weighted towards that last word. To deal with this problem, we use an \"attention\" mechanism that allows the decoder to look not only at all of the hidden states from the input, but it also learns which hidden states, for each step in decoding, to put the most weight on. We will discuss an attention implementation in a later version of this tutorial."

    "\n",
    "The [grapheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme) to [phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme) problem is a translation task that takes the letters of a word as the input sequence (the graphemes are the smallest units of a writing system) and outputs the corresponding phonemes; that is, the units of sound that make up a language.

    "## Task and Model Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed above, the task we are interested in solving is creating a model that takes some sequence as an input, and generates an output sequence based on the contents of the input. The model's job is to learn the mapping from the input sequence to the output sequence that it will generate. The job of the encoder is to come up with a good representation of the input that the decoder can use to generate a good output. For both the encoder and the decoder, the LSTM does a good job at this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the LSTM implementation from the CNTK Blocks library. This implements the \"smarts\" of the LSTM and we can more or less think of it as a black box. What is important to understand, however, is that there are two pieces to think of when implementing an RNN: the recurrence, which is the unrolled network over a sequence, and the block, which is the piece of the network run for each element of the sequence. We only need to implement the recurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps to think of the recurrence as a function that keeps calling `step(x)` on the block (in our case, LSTM). At a high level, it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class LSTM {\n",
    "    float hidden_state\n",
    "\n",
    "    init(initial_value):\n",
    "        hidden_state = initial_value\n",
    "\n",
    "    step(x):\n",
    "        hidden_state = LSTM_function(x, hidden_state)\n",
    "        return hidden_state\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, each call to the `step(x)` function takes some input `x`, modifies the internal `hidden_state`, and returns it. Therefore, with every input `x`, the value of the `hidden_state` evolves. Below we will import some required functionality, and then implement the recurrence that makes use of this mechanism."

    "\n",
    "One of the important concepts in understanding CNTK is the idea of two types of axes:\n",
    "- **static axes**, which are the traditional axes of a variable's shape, and\n",
    "- **dynamic axes**, which have dimensions that are unknown until the variable is bound to real data at computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic axes are particularly important in the world of recurrent neural networks. Instead of having to decide a maximum sequence length ahead of time, padding your sequences to that size, and wasting computation, CNTK's dynamic axes allow for variable sequence lengths that are automatically packed in minibatches to be as efficient as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "When setting up sequences, there are *two dynamic axes* that are important to consider. The first is the *batch axis*, which is the axis along which multiple sequences are batched. The second is the dynamic axis particular to that sequence. The latter is specific to a particular input because of variable sequence lengths in your data. For example, in sequence to sequence networks, we have two sequences: the **input sequence**, and the **output (or 'label') sequence**. One of the things that makes this type of network so powerful is that the length of the input sequence and the output sequence do not have to correspond to each other. Therefore, both the input sequence and the output sequence require their own unique dynamic axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining the input to a network, we set up the required dynamic axes and the shape of the input variables. Below, we define the shape (vocabulary size) of the inputs, create their dynamic axes, and finally create input variables that represent input nodes in our network."

This is obviously not optimal in general. Given the context, some word may always be the most probable at the first step, but another first word may be preferred given what is output later on. Decoding the optimal sequence is intractable in general. But we can do better doing a beam search where we keep around some small number of hypotheses at each step.

    "An important extension to sequence-to-sequence models, especially when dealing with long sequences, is to use an attention mechanism. The idea behind attention is to allow the decoder, first, to look at any of the hidden state outputs from the encoder (instead of using only the final hidden state), and, second, to learn how much attention to pay to each of those hidden states given the context. This allows the outputted word at each time step `t` to depend not only on the final hidden state and the word that came before it, but instead on a weighted combination of *all* of the input hidden states!\n",
