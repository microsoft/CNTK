    "In this tutorial, we are going to be talking about the fourth paradigm: many-to-many where the length of the output does not necessarily equal the length of the input, also known as sequence-to-sequence networks. The input is a sequence with a dynamic length, and the output is also a sequence with some dynamic length. It is the logical extension of the many-to-one paradigm in that previously we were predicting some category (which could easily be one of `V` words where `V` is an entire vocabulary) and now we want to predict a whole sequence of those categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The applications of sequence-to-sequence networks are nearly limitless. It is a natural fit for machine translation (e.g. English input sequences, French output sequences); automatic text summarization (e.g. full document input sequence, summary output sequence); word to pronunciation models (e.g. character [grapheme] input sequence, pronunciation [phoneme] output sequence); and even parse tree generation (e.g. regular text input, flat parse tree output).\n",

    "A sequence-to-sequence model consists of two main pieces: (1) an encoder; and (2) a decoder. Both the encoder and the decoder are recurrent neural network (RNN) layers that can be implemented using a vanilla RNN, an LSTM, or GRU Blocks (here we will use LSTM). In the basic sequence-to-sequence model, the encoder processes the input sequence into a fixed representation that is fed into the decoder as a context. The decoder then uses some mechanism (discussed below) to decode the processed information into an output sequence. The decoder is a language model that is augmented with some \"strong context\" by the encoder, and so each symbol that it generates is fed back into the decoder for additional context (like a traditional LM). For an English to German translation task, the most basic setup might look something like this:"

    "The basic sequence-to-sequence network passes the information from the encoder to the decoder by initializing the decoder RNN with the final hidden state of the encoder as its initial hidden state. The input is then a \"sequence start\" tag (`<s>` in the diagram above) which primes the decoder to start generating an output sequence. Then, whatever word (or note or image, etc.) it generates at that step is fed in as the input for the next step. The decoder keeps generating outputs until it hits the special \"end sequence\" tag (`</s>` above).\n",
    "\n",
    "A more complex and powerful version of the basic sequence-to-sequence network uses an attention model. While the above setup works well, it can start to break down when the input sequences get long. At each step, the hidden state `h` is getting updated with the most recent information, and therefore `h` might be getting \"diluted\" in information as it processes each token. Further, even with a relatively short sequence, the last token will always get the last say and therefore the thought vector will be somewhat biased/weighted towards that last word. To deal with this problem, we use an \"attention\" mechanism that allows the decoder to look not only at all of the hidden states from the input, but it also learns which hidden states, for each step in decoding, to put the most weight on. In this tutorial we will implement a sequence-to-sequence network that can be run either with or without attention enabled."

The model's job is to learn the mapping from the input sequence to the output sequence that it will generate. The job of the encoder is to come up with a good representation of the input that the decoder can use to generate a good output. For both the encoder and the decoder, the LSTM does a good job at this.\n",

Each processes its input slightly differently and each has its own benefits and drawbacks for different types of tasks and networks. To get these blocks to run for each of the elements recurrently in a network, we create a `Recurrence` over them.

    "\n",
    "One of the important concepts in understanding CNTK is the idea of two types of axes:\n",
    "- **static axes**, which are the traditional axes of a variable's shape, and\n",
    "- **dynamic axes**, which have dimensions that are unknown until the variable is bound to real data at computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic axes are particularly important in the world of recurrent neural networks. Instead of having to decide a maximum sequence length ahead of time, padding your sequences to that size, and wasting computation, CNTK's dynamic axes allow for variable sequence lengths that are automatically packed in minibatches to be as efficient as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "When setting up sequences, there are *two dynamic axes* that are important to consider. The first is the *batch axis*, which is the axis along which multiple sequences are batched. The second is the dynamic axis particular to that sequence. The latter is specific to a particular input because of variable sequence lengths in your data. For example, in sequence to sequence networks, we have two sequences: the **input sequence**, and the **output (or 'label') sequence**. One of the things that makes this type of network so powerful is that the length of the input sequence and the output sequence do not have to correspond to each other. Therefore, both the input sequence and the output sequence require their own unique dynamic axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first create the `inputAxis` for the input sequence and the `labelAxis` for the output sequence. We then define the inputs to the model by creating sequences over these two unique dynamic axes. Note that `InputSequence` and `LabelSequence` are *type declarations*. This means that the `InputSequence` is a type that consists of a sequence over the `inputAxis` axis."

    "\n",
    "As discussed before, the sequence-to-sequence network is, at its most basic, an RNN (LSTM) encoder followed by an RNN (LSTM) decoder, and a dense output layer. We will implement both the Encoder and the Decoder using the CNTK Layers library. Both of these will be created as CNTK Functions. Our `create_model()` Python function creates both the `encode` and `decode` CNTK Functions. The `decode` function directly makes use of the `encode` function and the return value of `create_model()` is the CNTK Function `decode` itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by passing the input through an embedding (learned as part of the training process). So that this function can be used in the `Sequential` block of the Encoder and the Decoder whether we want an embedding or not, we will use the `identity` function if the `use_embedding` parameter is `False`. We then declare the Encoder layers as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we pass the input through our `embed` function and then we stabilize it. This adds an additional scalar parameter to the learning that can help our network converge more quickly during training. Then, for each of the number of LSTM layers that we want in our encoder, except the final one, we set up an LSTM recurrence. The final recurrence will be a `Fold` if we are not using attention because we only pass the final hidden state to the decoder. If we are using attention, however, then we use another normal LSTM `Recurrence` that the Decoder will put its attention over later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we see a diagram of how the layered version of the sequence-to-sequence network with attention works. As the code shows below, the output of each layer of the Encoder and Decoder is used as the input to the layer just above it. The Attention model focuses on the top layer of the Encoder and informs the first layer of the Decoder."

    "For the decoder, we first define several sub-layers: the `Stabilizer` for the decoder input, the `Recurrence` blocks for each of the decoder's layers, the `Stabilizer` for the output of the stack of LSTMs, and the final `Dense` output layer. If we are using attention, then we also create an `AttentionModel` function `attention_model` which returns an augmented version of the decoder's hidden state with emphasis placed on the encoder hidden states that should be most used for the given step while generating the next output token.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then build the CNTK Function `decode`. The decorator `@Function` turns a regular Python function into a proper CNTK Function with the given arguments and return value. The Decoder works differently during training than it does during test time. During training, the history (i.e. input) to the Decoder `Recurrence` consists of the ground-truth labels. This means that while generating $y^{(t=2)}$, for example, the input will be $y^{(t=1)}$. During evaluation, or \"test time\", however, the input to the Decoder will be the actual output of the model. For a greedy decoder -- which we are implementing here -- that input is therefore the `hardmax` of the final `Dense` layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Decoder Function `decode` takes two arguments: (1) the `input` sequence; and (2) the Decoder `history`. First, it runs the `input` sequence through the Encoder function `encode` that we setup earlier. We then get the `history` and map it to its embedding if necessary. Then the embedded representation is stabilized before running it through the Decoder's `Recurrence`. For each layer of `Recurrence`, we run the embedded `history` (now represented as `r`) through the `Recurrence`'s LSTM. If we are not using attention, we run it through the `Recurrence` with its initial state set to the value of the final hidden state of the encoder (note that since we run the Encoder backwards when not using attention that the \"final\" hidden state is actually the first hidden state in chronological time). If we are using attention, however, then we calculate the auxiliary input `h_att` using our `attention_model` function and we splice that onto the input `x`. This augmented `x` is then used as input for the Decoder's `Recurrence`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we stabilize the output of the Decoder, put it through the final `Dense` layer `proj_out`, and label the output using the `Label` layer which allows for simple access to that layer later on."

    "If you're using the model that was trained for one full epoch, then you should get a phoneme error rate of around 10%. Not bad! This means that for each of the 383,294 phonemes in the test set, our model predicted nearly 90% of them correctly (if you used the quickly-trained version of the model then you will get an error rate of around 45%). Now, let's work with an interactive session where we can input our own input sequences and see how the model predicts their pronunciation (i.e. phonemes). Additionally, we will visualize the Decoder's attention for these samples to see which graphemes in the input it deemed to be important for each phoneme that it produces. Note that in the examples below the results will only be good if you use a model that has been trained for at least one epoch."

Please note that the results will be very poor if you just use the model that was trained for a very short amount of time. The model we used just above that was trained for one epoch does a good job, and if you have the time and patience to train the model for a full 30 epochs, it will perform very nicely.\n",

    "With the above model, you have the basics for training a powerful sequence-to-sequence model with attention in a number of distinct domains. The only major changes required are preparing a dataset with pairs input and output sequences and in general the rest of the building blocks will remain the same. Good luck, and have fun!"
