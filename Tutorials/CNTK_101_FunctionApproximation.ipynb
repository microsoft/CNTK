    "# CNTK 101: Function Approximation Primer\n",
    "This tutorial is targeted to individuals who are new to CNTK and to machine learning. In this tutorial, you will train a learning model that can be used to approximate continuious functions. See the [Universal Approximation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem). Simple models with a few neurons can approximate a wide variety of equations and Function Approximation is a powerful machine learning tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is for CNTK Python APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**:\n",
    "A business has a large amount of data they wish to use in a predictive fashion. You can create a function approximation to make predictions on new data based on examples from the past. This toy example uses very simple functions for the model to approximate. It's important to understand how to get a trivial model to train well before attempting to predict more complicated models. The first model has three features (y1, y2, y3) and one label (x) where x = y (y2 and y3 are irrellevant). The model should be able to approximate x = y. The second model is slightly more complex x = 100y1+n +10y2+n +y3+n. The model should be able to approximate this easily as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**:\n",
    "Our goal is to learn to create a model than can approximate simple functions. We will also show you to to create and read CNTK formatted data files and how to standardize data.\n",
