NVML API Reference

The NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) is a C-based programmatic interface for monitoring and 
managing various states within NVIDIA Tesla &tm; GPUs. It is intended to be a platform for building
3rd party applications, and is also the underlying library for the NVIDIA-supported nvidia-smi
tool. NVML is thread-safe so it is safe to make simultaneous NVML calls from multiple threads.

The NVML library can be found at \%ProgramW6432\%\\"NVIDIA Corporation"\\NVSMI\\ on Windows, but
will not be added to the path. To dynamically link to NVML, add this path to the PATH environmental
variable. To dynamically load NVML, call LoadLibrary with this path.

On Linux the NVML library will be found on the standard library path. For 64 bit Linux, both the 32 bit
and 64 bit NVML libraries will be installed.
