# CNTK Dockerfiles

The Dockerfiles provided here can be used to build CNTK on machines with only CPU, or with GPU with or without 1bit-SGD.
If you plan to use the 1bit-SGD version, please make sure you understand the 
[license difference between CNTK and 1bit-SGD](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Enabling-1bit-SGD).

See also [this page](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/CNTK-Docker-Containers) 
that provides general instructions on getting things working with Docker.
