CNTK offers both options because in some setups it is more convenient to work with per sample learning rates than per minibatch learning rates and vice versa. For example, per minibatch learning rate schedules, typically don't require retuning when you want to change the minibatch size, but per sample schedules do.

    "\n",
    "Among these learners, `momentum_sgd`, `nesterov`, `fsadagrad`, and `adam` take an additional momemtum schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum means that instead of updating the parameter using the current gradient we update the parameter using all previous gradients exponentially decayed . If there is a consistent direction that the gradients are pointing to, the parameter updates will develop momentum in that direction. [This page](http://distill.pub/2017/momentum/) has a good explanation of momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the learning rate schedule, the momentum schedule can be specified in two equivalent ways:\n",

    "The difference between the two calls is just a simple transformation which can be explained as follows. Since momentum is creating a sort of exponential moving average it is fair to ask \"when does the contribution of an old gradient diminish by a certain constant factor?\". If we choose the constant factor to be $0.5$ we call this the [half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life) and if we choose the constant to be $e^{-1}\\approx 0.368$ we call this the [time constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_constant). So `momentum_as_time_constant_schedule` specifies the number of samples it would take for a gradient to decay to $0.368$ of its original contribution on the momentum term. Specifying a `momentum_as_time_constant_schedule(300)` is a little bit more meaningful than specifying `momentum_schedule(.967...)` even though both lead to the same updates. The way to convert between the two schedules is\n",

    "\n",
    "Apart from the momentum schedule, the momentum learners can also take a boolean \"unit_gain\" argument that determines the form of the momentum update:\n",
    "- `unit_gain=True`: $\\textrm{momentum_direction} = \\textrm{momentum} \\cdot \\textrm{old_momentum_direction} + (1 - \\textrm{momentum}) \\cdot \\textrm{gradient}$\n",
    "- `unit_gain=False`: $\\textrm{momentum_direction} = \\textrm{momentum} \\cdot \\textrm{old_momentum_direction} + \\textrm{gradient}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the non-conventional `unit_gain=True` is that when momentum and or learning rate changes this way of updating does not lead to divergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code illustrates that for the case of `unit_gain=False`, the two ways of specifying momentum (as time constant or not) are equivalent. It also shows that when `unit_gain=True` you need to scale your learning rate by $1/(1-\\textrm{momentum})$ to match the `unit_gain=False` case"

    "### Learners with individual learning rates\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the builtin learners, `adagrad`, `rmsprop`, `fsadagrad`, `adam`, and `adadelta` have rules for tuning the learning rate of each parameter individually. They still require the tuning of a global learning rate that gets multiplied with the individual learning rate of each parameter but the hope is that these techniques can achieve better results by taking advantage of the fact that, for example, if the inputs are word ids then some features appear more rarely than others and therefore the learning rate for the parameters associated with rare feature should depend on how often those features have been seen rather than how many minibatches have been processed. \n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are typically easier to tune, but there is some new evidence that [they overfit more easily](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08292) than SGD with momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we show how these learners can be configured and the effect their updates have on the parameters. \n",
    "The main take-away is that **if you switch learners, you need to retune the learning rate**. In this example the sequence of initial points and gradients is the same yet different learners arrive at different parameter values after 10 minibatches. However if we retune the learning rates, the learner with the smallest parameter value (adadelta), we can reach as large parameter values as the one with the largest parameter value (adamax). Also this is an artificial example where gradients are consistently equal to 1 so the methods that have momemtum builtin (`adam`/`adamax`/`fsadagrad`) should get higher parameter values than the methods that don't have momentum builtin (for the same value of the learning rate)."
