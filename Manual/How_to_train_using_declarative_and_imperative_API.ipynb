    "# Manual: How to train model using declarative and imperative API\n",
    " \n",
    "CNTK gives the user several ways how her model can be trained:\n",
    "* High level declarative style API using [Function.train](https://www.cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.ops.functions.html#cntk.ops.functions.Function.train) method (or training_session). Given a criterion function, the user can simply call the train method, providing configuration parameters for different aspects of the training, such as data sources, checkpointing, cross validation and progress printing. The corresponding [test](https://www.cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.ops.functions.html#cntk.ops.functions.Function.test) method can be used for evaluation. This API simplifies implementation of routine training tasks and eliminates boilerplate code.\n",
    "* Using low level [Trainer.train_minibatch](https://www.cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.train.trainer.html#cntk.train.trainer.Trainer.train_minibatch) or [test](https://www.cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.train.trainer.html#cntk.train.trainer.Trainer.test_minibatch) methods. In this case the user writes the minibatch loop explicitly and has full control of all aspects. It is more flexible than the first option but is more error prone and requires deeper understanding of concepts especially in a distribution environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "This document is organized as follows: firstly, we will give an example how a typical imperative loop looks like and what are its caveats in a distributed environment. Then we present how declarative API looks like and how it simplifies development and eliminates potential errors. If you are interested only in using the high level API (in generarl you should always use it instead of explicit minibatch loop) please jump directly to [the corresponding Function.train section](## Using Function.train/(training session)).\n",

    "[Checkpoint configuration](https://www.cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.train.training_session.html#cntk.train.training_session.CheckpointConfig) specifies how often to save a checkpoint to the given file. The checkpointing frequency is specified in samples. When given, the method takes care of saving/restoring the state across the trainer/learners/minibatch source and propagating this information among distributed workers. If you need to preserve all checkpoints that were taken during training, please set `preserveAll` to true. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation\n",
    "When [cross validation](https://www.cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.train.training_session.html#cntk.train.training_session.CrossValidationConfig) config is given, the training session runs the validation on the specified minibatch source with the specified frequency and reports average metric error. The user can also provide a cross validation callback, that will be called with the specified frequency. It is up to the user to perform validation in the callback and return back `True` if the training should be continued, or `False` otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing\n",
    "If the test configuration is given, after completion of training, the train method runs evaluation on the specified minibatch source. If you need to run only evaluation without training, consider using [Function.test](https://www.cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.ops.functions.html#cntk.ops.functions.Function.test) method instead.\n",
    "\n",
