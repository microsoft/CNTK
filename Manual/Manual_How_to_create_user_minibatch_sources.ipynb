    "\n",
    "In order to make use of CNTKâ€™s (distributed) training functionality, one has to provide input data as an instance of [MinibatchSource](https://cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.io.html#cntk.io.MinibatchSource). In CNTK, there are a variety of means to provide minibatch sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (**best**) convert data to the formats of built-in data readers - they support rich functionality of randomization/packing with high performance (see [How to feed data](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/master/Manual/Manual_How_to_feed_data.ipynb) and [cntk.io](https://cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.io.html))\n",
    "- (**preferred**) if it is hard to convert the data and the data can fit in memory, please use [MinibatchSourceFromData](https://cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.io.html?highlight=minibatchsourcefromdata#cntk.io.MinibatchSourceFromData), \n",
    "- if the data does not fit in memory and you want a fine grained control over how minibatch is created, then implementing the abstract  [UserMinibatchSource](https://cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.io.html#cntk.io.UserMinibatchSource) interface is the option. \n",
    "\n",
    "This manual explains the last approach: How to create user minibatch source in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## User minibatch sources\n",
    "\n",
    "A minibatch source is responsible for providing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. meta-information regarding the data, such as *storage format*, *data type*, *shape of elements*,\n",
    "2. batches of data, and\n",
    "3. auxiliary information for advanced features, such as checkpoint state of the current data access position so that  interrupted learning processes can be restored from the data position where the processes were interrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correspondingly, a minibatch source API needs to implement the following $4$ methods (see [UserMinibatchSource](https://cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.io.html?highlight=userminibatch#cntk.io.UserMinibatchSource) for details):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **stream_infos()**: Returns a list of StreamInformation instances. Each piece of stream information contains the meta information regarding a stream of the data: e.g.  storage format, data type, shape of elements  (see [StreamInformation](https://cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.io.html#cntk.io.StreamInformation) for details) \n",
    "2. **next_minibatch(num_samples, number_of_workers, worker_rank, device=None)**: Returns next minibatch of data of the specified nature as specified by given parameters:\n",
    "    * num_samples: the number of samples that are being requested \n",
    "    * num_of_workders: the number of workers in a distributed training session; if it is not in a distributed training setting, this number is always 1\n",
    "    * worker_rank: the number which identifies the specific worker who requests this minibatch in the distributed training setting; if this is not a distributed training session, the worker rank is always 0 (the first worker)\n",
    "    * device: a device descriptor specifying which device the minibatch data should be copied to, e.g. cntk.device.cpu() or cntk.device.gpu(device_id)  (see [DeviceDescriptor](https://cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.device.html#cntk.device.DeviceDescriptor) for details)\n",
    "3. **get_checkpoint_state()**: Returns a dictionary which describe the current state of the minibatch source\n",
    "4. **restore_from_checkpoint(state)**: Sets the state of the minibatch source according to a checkint state object. This allows a minibatch source restoring data feeding from position where the checkpoint was saved. Note that *state* is the dictionary returned by get_checkpoint_state(). \n",

    "### Inherit *UserMinibatchSource* to create your user minibatch class: \n",
    "\n",
    "To implement our example user minibatch source, we first prepare the data access and its meta information: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parse the text formatted data into an intermediate representation so that we can access the data by their sequence indices: \n",
    "```\n",
    "    features = self.data[seq_idx]['features']\n",
    "    labels = self.data[seq_idx]['labels']\n",
    "```\n",
    "    This is done by create a private method ``_prepare_data()`` in the example below. We ommit the implementation detail of text format parsing here as the detail is irrelevant to the understanding of the UserMinibatchSource interface. However, the parsing mechanims should be able to keep track of where the current data access point is so that the data feeding process can be restored at any point. In the example, we are tracking the sequence index. \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Define the meta information of the data: e.g.\n",
    "```\n",
    "        self.fsi = StreamInformation(\"features\", 0, 'sparse', np.float32, (self.f_dim,))\n",
    "        self.lsi = StreamInformation(\"labels\", 1, 'dense', np.float32, (self.l_dim,))\n",
    "```\n",
    "    The self.fsi and self.lsi define the meta information (see [StreamInformation](https://cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.io.html#cntk.io.StreamInformation) for definition ) regarding the features and labels respectively.  For example,  ``StreamInformation(\"features\", 0, 'sparse', np.float32, (self.f_dim,))`` specifies that :\n",
    "    \n",
    ">a) the \"feature\" data stream is indentified by  ID $0$ (it is required that every data stream is identified by a unique ID), \n",

    "\n",
    ">c) its data type is ``np.float32``, and \n",
    "\n",
    ">d) its dimension is ``(self.f_dim, )``.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Set the initial states of the data source. For example, set the next sequence index to the beginning:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    self.next_seq_idx = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, create your minibatch class based on **UserMinibatchSource** and put the above data access preparation steps in its constructor: \n",

Note that different data streams might contain different number of samples. In addition, *sweep_end* tells whether this minibatch is at the end of a sweep of the whole data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "To define user minibatch source that can be used with distributed learners, e.g. BlockMomentum. We will need to use number_of_workers to cut the data into slices and then return the slices depending on which worker_rank requested the next minibatch.
