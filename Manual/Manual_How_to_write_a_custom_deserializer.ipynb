    "# Manual: How to write a custom deserializer\n",
    " \n",
    "In this manual we describe how to load data using CNTK custom deserializers. CNTK also provides other means for loading data (i.e. built-in deserializers, user defined minibatch sources or feeding NumPy data explicitly), for more details please have a look at the [How to feed data](Manual_How_to_feed_data.ipynb) manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why use custom deserializers in the first place? The main reason is that you have some custom format that CNTK does not support out of the box and you would like to load your data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom deserializers give the user the following advantages:\n",
    "1. Flexibility: the user can deserialize any format she wants.\n",
    "1. Simplicity: writing a new deserializer is relatively easy. \n",
    "1. Efficiency: the data will be prefetched automatically (when possible) and moved to GPU memory on a separate thread. In conjunction with Function.train API this allows the main Python thread to concentrate fully on deserialization and IO prefetching.\n",
    "1. Randomization: each new sweep the data will be randomized.\n",
    "1. Checkpointing: checkpoints are supported out of the box.\n",
    "1. Distribution: CNTK will know how to distribute chunks to different workers in a distributed environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Please note, that due to CPython limitations only a single thread is allowed to interpret Python script at any point in time, so if you perform some heavy CPU work during deserialization this will still influence your performance because it cannot be effectively parallelized. We recommend using built-in deserializers for CPU hungry workloads._**\n",

    "## 1. Main concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "The main responsibility of a deserializer is to take serialized data from an external storage and create an in-memory representation of the sequence (or sample) that can be consumed by the network.\n",
    "The interface of the deserializer is simple and consists of three main methods:\n",
    " - __stream_infos__: similarly to built-in deserializers, this function returns a list of streams this deserializer will provide. Each stream is described by its name, data type, format and shape\n",
    " - __num_chunks__: returns the number of data chunks.To make IO efficient the deserializer does not operate on a single sequence, instead it operates in chunks. A chunk is just a set of sequences that can be read in an efficient manner (for example, in case of CSV file on disk, it makes sense to read 32 or 64MBs in one go).\n",
    " - __get_chunk(chunk_id)__: given a chunk identifier (0 <= __chunk_id__ < __num_chunks__) the deserializer should return an array or a CSR matrix of samples/sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement a simple custom deserializer that will hold all its data in memory as a single chunk:"

Randomization happens each sweep and is two-fold: firstly all chunks are randomized, then the window of chunks is created (controlled using `randomization_window_in_chunks` or `randomization_window_in_samples` parameters) and all sequences inside the window are randomized in their own turn.\n",

If you want your application to make better use of the computational resources of multi-core machines, you are advised to use multiprocessing or concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor. However, threading is still an appropriate model if you want to run multiple I/O-bound tasks simultaneously._\n",
