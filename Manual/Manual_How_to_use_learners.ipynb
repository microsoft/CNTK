    "\n",
    "Among the built-in learners, `adagrad`, `rmsprop`, `fsadagrad`, `adam`, and `adadelta` have rules for tuning the learning rate of each parameter individually. They still require the tuning of a global learning rate that gets multiplied with the individual learning rate of each parameter. At the heart of these techniques is basically the idea that we can perform sgd on each parameter separately. This can be useful if some features appear less often than others and therefore different features are updated at different frequencies. With a single learning rate we run the risk of decaying it a lot before we see a rare feature (e.g. a rate word). Instead we might want the updates to depend on how often those features have been seen rather than how many minibatches have been processed. \n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are typically easier to tune, but there is some new evidence that [they overfit more easily](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08292) than SGD with momentum.\n",

    "Below, we show how these learners can be configured and how their updates affect the model parameters. \n",
    "The main take-away is that **if you switch learners, you need to retune the learning rate**. In this example the initial points and gradients are the same yet different learners arrive at different parameter values after 10 minibatches. Since the mean gradients are always 1, it is fair to say that in this case the learner with the most negative parameter value is the best. However, if we retune the learning rates, the learner with the least negative parameter value (fsadagrad, adam and adammax), we can drive its parameters to similar values as the ones with the very negative parameter value (e.g. adam, adamax and fsadagrad)."

    "If you want to experiment with your own learner, you should first try to write it as a CNTK expression. This is much faster than the next alternative, which is to write it in Python. CNTK has a **universal learner** that accepts a function as an argument. This function takes a list of parameters and gradients and creates an expression (a network) that, when evaluated, will assign new values to the parameters according to the learning rule you coded. At the time of this writing, the universal learner does not support schedules for learning rate and momentum. If this is necessary, the user must create a new learner. Another shortcoming of this learner is it only supports densely stored gradients. If you get an error that a quantity is not dense, you have two options:\n",

Still, there can be rare cases where you want to perform an update that cannot be currently implemented as a CNTK expression. In those cases you can implement your learner as a Python class. CNTK will then call its update method during training. Since this means the training loop (C++ code) is calling into Python (your learner) for every single minibatch, this approach is the slowest of all options.\n",

The trainer will call the learner's `update` method by supplying it a dictionary, whose keys are the parameters and whose values are the corresponding gradients, as well as the number of samples in the minibatch and whether we have reached the end of a sweep through the data. The implementation of `update` is totally up to you.\n",

In the `update` method, for each parameter-gradient pair we look up the expression corresponding to the shape of the parameter, bind the gradient to the input of the expression and evaluate the expression. Finally, we slice the result to get rid of the batch axis and update the parameter. We have also slightly modified the `inspect_update` method to make it work with a user defined learner."

Specifying a `momentum_as_time_constant_schedule(300)` and a minibatch size of 10 is a little bit more meaningful than specifying `momentum_schedule(.967...)` even though both lead to the same updates.
