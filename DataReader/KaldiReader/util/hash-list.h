/* This header provides utilities for a structure that's used in a decoder (but
   is quite generic in nature so we implement and test it separately).
   Basically it's a singly-linked list, but implemented in such a way that we
   can quickly search for elements in the list.  We give it a slightly richer
   interface than just a hash and a list.  The idea is that we want to separate
   the hash part and the list part: basically, in the decoder, we want to have a
   single hash for the current frame and the next frame, because by the time we
   need to access the hash for the next frame we no longer need the hash for the
   previous frame.  So we have an operation that clears the hash but leaves the
   list structure intact.  We also control memory management inside this object,
   to avoid repeated new's/deletes.

   See hash-list-test.cc for an example of how to use this object.
