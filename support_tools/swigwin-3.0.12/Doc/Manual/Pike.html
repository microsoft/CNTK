<p>
This chapter describes SWIG support for Pike. As of this writing, the
SWIG  Pike module is still under development and is not considered
ready for prime  time. The Pike module is being developed against the
Pike 7.4.10 release  and may not be compatible with previous versions
of Pike.
</p>

<p>
This chapter covers most SWIG features, but certain low-level details
are  covered in less depth than in earlier chapters.  At the very
least, make sure you read the "<a href="SWIG.html#SWIG">SWIG Basics</a>"
chapter.<br>
</p>

<H2><a name="Pike_nn2">35.1 Preliminaries</a></H2>


<H3><a name="Pike_nn3">35.1.1 Running SWIG</a></H3>


<p>
Suppose that you defined a SWIG module such as the following:
</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>%module example<br><br>%{<br>#include "example.h"<br>%}<br><br>int fact(int n);<br></pre>
</div>

<p>
To build a C extension module for Pike, run SWIG using the <tt>-pike</tt> option :
</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>$ <b>swig -pike example.i</b><br></pre>
</div>

<p>
If you're building a C++ extension, be sure to add the <tt>-c++</tt> option:
</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>$ <b>swig -c++ -pike example.i</b><br></pre>
</div>

<p>
This creates a single source file named <tt>example_wrap.c</tt> (or <tt>example_wrap.cxx</tt>, if you
ran SWIG with the <tt>-c++</tt> option).
The SWIG-generated source file contains the low-level wrappers that need
to be compiled and linked with the rest of your C/C++ application to
create an extension module.
</p>

<p>
The name of the wrapper file is derived from the name of the input
file.  For example, if the input file is <tt>example.i</tt>, the name
of the wrapper file is <tt>example_wrap.c</tt>. To change this, you
can use the <tt>-o</tt> option:
</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>$ <b>swig -pike -o pseudonym.c example.i</b><br></pre>
</div>
<H3><a name="Pike_nn4">35.1.2 Getting the right header files</a></H3>


<p>
In order to compile the C/C++ wrappers, the compiler needs to know the
path to the Pike header files. These files are usually contained in a
directory such as
</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>/usr/local/pike/7.4.10/include/pike<br></pre>
</div>

<p>
There doesn't seem to be any way to get Pike itself to reveal the
location of these files, so you may need to hunt around for them.
You're looking for files with the names <tt>global.h</tt>, <tt>program.h</tt>
and so on.
</p>

<H3><a name="Pike_nn5">35.1.3 Using your module</a></H3>


<p>
To use your module, simply use Pike's <tt>import</tt> statement:
</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
$ <b>pike</b>
Pike v7.4 release 10 running Hilfe v3.5 (Incremental Pike Frontend)
&gt; <b>import example;</b>
&gt; <b>fact(4);</b>
(1) Result: 24
</pre></div>

<H2><a name="Pike_nn6">35.2 Basic C/C++ Mapping</a></H2>


<H3><a name="Pike_nn7">35.2.1 Modules</a></H3>


<p>
All of the code for a given SWIG module is wrapped into a single Pike
module. Since the name of the shared library that implements your
module ultimately determines the module's name (as far as Pike is
concerned), SWIG's <tt>%module</tt> directive doesn't really have any
significance.
</p>

<H3><a name="Pike_nn8">35.2.2 Functions</a></H3>


<p>
Global functions are wrapped as new Pike built-in functions. For
example,
</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
%module example

int fact(int n);
</pre></div>

<p>
creates a new built-in function <tt>example.fact(n)</tt> that works
exactly as you'd expect it to:
</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
&gt; <b>import example;</b>
&gt; <b>fact(4);</b>
(1) Result: 24
</pre></div>

<H3><a name="Pike_nn9">35.2.3 Global variables</a></H3>


<p>
Global variables are currently wrapped as a pair of functions, one to get
the current value of the variable and another to set it. For example, the
declaration
</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
%module example

double Foo;
</pre></div>

<p>
will result in two functions, <tt>Foo_get()</tt> and <tt>Foo_set()</tt>:
</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
&gt; <b>import example;</b>
&gt; <b>Foo_get();</b>
(1) Result: 3.000000
&gt; <b>Foo_set(3.14159);</b>
(2) Result: 0
&gt; <b>Foo_get();</b>
(3) Result: 3.141590
</pre></div>

<H3><a name="Pike_nn10">35.2.4 Constants and enumerated types</a></H3>


<p>
Enumerated types in C/C++ declarations are wrapped as Pike constants,
not as Pike enums.
</p>

<H3><a name="Pike_nn11">35.2.5 Constructors and Destructors</a></H3>


<p>
Constructors are wrapped as <tt>create()</tt> methods, and destructors are
wrapped as <tt>destroy()</tt> methods, for Pike classes.
</p>

<H3><a name="Pike_nn12">35.2.6 Static Members</a></H3>


<p>
Since Pike doesn't support static methods or data for Pike classes, static
member functions in your C++ classes are wrapped as regular functions and
static member variables are wrapped as pairs of functions (one to get the
value of the static member variable, and another to set it). The names of
these functions are prepended with the name of the class.
For example, given this C++ class declaration:
</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
class Shape
{
public:
    static void print();
    static int nshapes;
};
</pre></div>

<p>
SWIG will generate a <tt>Shape_print()</tt> method that invokes the static
<tt>Shape::print()</tt> member function, as well as a pair of methods,
<tt>Shape_nshapes_get()</tt> and <tt>Shape_nshapes_set()</tt>, to get and set
the value of <tt>Shape::nshapes</tt>.
</p>
