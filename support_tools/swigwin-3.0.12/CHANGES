Version 3.0.11 (29 Dec 2016)
============================

2016-12-24: wsfulton
            [C#] Add %feature("csdirectordelegatemodifiers") to enable customization
            of the delegate access modifiers generated in director classes.
            Fixes issue #748.

2016-12-23: wsfulton
            [Python] Fix builtin "python:slot" feature failing for tp_hash when using
            hashfunc closure with a "Wrong type for hash function" for Python 2.
            Issue #843.

2016-12-21: joequamt
            Changed generation of functions so that only functions
            that end in _set generate accessor functions rather than
	    looking for "set".
	    Change generation of operators to not have underscores
	    to start in R. Users need to provide custom names for these operator overloads.

2016-12-21: olly
	    Fix isfinite() checks to work with all C++11 compilers.
	    Fixes issues #615, #788 and #849.

2016-12-20: wsfulton
            %namewarn unnecessarily caused keyword warnings for non-instantiated template classes
            and duplicate warnings for instantiated template classes when keywords were used.
            Issue #845.

2016-12-18: ezralanglois 
            [Python, Ruby, Octave] Memory leak fix on error in std::pair wrappers.
            Issue #851.

2016-12-18: wsfulton
            Zero initialize arrays when using %array_class and %array_functions.

2016-12-18: t-ikegami
            [Python] Fix #446
            Python %array_class of carrays.i failed with -builtin option.

2016-12-16: briancaine
            [Guile] Patch #744 Added support for Guile's native pointer functionality

2016-12-01: wsfulton
            [Python] Issue #769.
            Add optional moduleimport attribute to %module so that the
            default module import code can be overridden. See the "Searching for the wrapper module"
            documentation in Python.html. Example:

              %module(moduleimport="import _foo") foo

            $module also expands to the low-level C/C++ module name, so the following is the
            same as above

              %module(moduleimport="import $module") foo

2016-11-30: olly
	    [PHP] Add support for PHP7.  PHP5's C extension API has changed
	    substantially so you need to use -php7 to specify you want PHP7
	    compatible wrappers.  The default extension for generated wrappers
	    is now .cxx (to match SWIG's default for every other language - to
	    generate foo_wrap.cpp you can run SWIG with -cppext cpp).  Fixes
	    issue #571.

	    As part of this change, the language subdirectory for PHP5 has
	    changed from "php" to "php5" - if you are making use of the search
	    path feature where the language subdirectory of each directory
	    is also searched, you'll need to update your bindings.  A simple
	    fix which works for older and newer SWIG is to add a symlink:
	    ln -s php php5

	    *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

2016-11-30: olly
	    [PHP] Only emit one copy of each distinct arginfo.  Previously we
	    emitted a separate one for every wrapped function, but typically
	    many functions have the same number of parameters and combinations
	    of parameters passed by reference or not.

	    This change significantly reduces both the size of the generated
	    wrapper, and of the compiled PHP extension module (e.g. by ~6% for
	    the stripped extension module for Xapian's PHP7 bindings).

2016-11-28: wsfulton
            Fix %rename override of wildcard %rename for templates. For example:

              %rename(GlobalIntOperator) *::operator bool; // wildcard %rename

              %rename(XIntOperator) X::operator bool; // fix now overrides first %rename above
              OR
              %rename(XIntOperator) X<int>::operator bool; // fix now overrides first %rename above

              template<typename T> struct X {
                operator bool();
                ...
              };
              %template(Xint) X<int>;

            This also fixes %rename override of global %rename for templates. For example:

              // Global rename to make all functions start with a lower case letter
              %rename("%(firstlowercase)s", %$isfunction ) "";
              %rename(woohoo) W::Woo; // fix now overrides above %rename

              template<typename T> struct W {
                W Woo();
                ...
              };
              %template(Wint) W<int>;

            The above also introduces a possibly unexpected change. Many of the STL containers
            provided by SWIG use %rename to rename some methods, eg in std::vector, push_back
            is renamed to add in Java. Previously this intended rename did not happen when using
            using global %rename rules and the method would remain as push_back, but is now
            renamed to add. Some more info in issue #856.

	    *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

2016-11-26: m7thon
            [Python] Issue #709 - improved wrapping of division operators
            'from __future__ import division' now works in Python 2 whether or not the
            -py3 flag is used.

2016-11-12: joequant
            [R] Issue #697 - fix comma issue with overload methods

2016-11-12: joequant
	    [R] Issue #555 - R runtime needs stdio.h

2016-11-02: wsfulton
            [Python] Issue #816 - fix compilation error when using -extranative and -builtin.

2016-11-02: liorgold
            Patch #741 - Add support for C++11 alias templates, see updated CPlusPlus11.html
            documentation.

2016-10-30: myd7349
            [C#] Patch #740 Add std_array.i for C# for wrapping std::array.

            Patch also enhances std::vector<std::wstring> C# wrappers with additional functions
            (Contains, IndexOf, LastIndexOf and Remove).

2016-10-30: tobilau
            [Java] Fix wrappers for wstring parameters in director methods to cleanup local
            ref after director callback has finished.

2016-10-23: wsfulton
            [C#] Add missing csdirectorin VOID_INT_PTR and csdirectorout VOID_INT_PTR typemaps.

2016-10-23: jiulongw
            Patch #781 - Fix wrapping of C compound expressions containing char constants
            in quotes such as:

              #define H_SUPPRESS_SCALING_MAGIC (('s'<<24) | ('u'<<16) | ('p'<<8) | 'p')

              enum DifferentTypes {
                typecharcompound='A'+1,
                typecharcompound2='B' << 2
              };

2016-10-13: wsfulton
            [Python] Issue #808 - fix Python pickling and metaclass for builtin wrappers.

            The metaclass (SwigPyObjectType) for SWIG objects was not defined in
            a way that let importlib successfully import the Python wrappers.
            The pickle module previously failed to pickle objects because it couldn't
            determine what module the SWIG wrapped objects were in.

2016-09-29: wsfulton
            [Allegrocl, CFFI, GO, Javascript, Ocaml, R, Scilab]
            Add missing support for the "ret" typemap in a few target languages.
            The documentation also now has info on the "ret" typemap.

2016-09-27: ahmed-usman
            [xml] Handle template parameters correctly.

2016-09-27: dontpanic92
            [Go] Fix argument names in inherited functions taking more than 8
            parameters.  Fixes #795.

2016-09-26: smarchetto
            [Scilab] mlists that map pointers can be given a custom type name.

2016-09-25: wsfulton
            Patch #793 from q-p to expand exception handling to include std::bad_cast
            in std_except.i.

2016-09-24: olly
            [PHP] Fix code generated for feature("director:except") -
            previously the return value of call_user_function() was ignored and
            we checked an uninitialised value instead.  Fixes #627.  Based on
            patch from Sergey Seroshtan.

2016-09-22: wsfulton
            [Python] More flexible python builtin slots for overloaded C++ function.

            The closure names used for builtin slots are mangled with their functype so
            that overloaded C++ method names can be used for multiple slots.
            For example:

              %feature("python:slot", "mp_subscript", functype="binaryfunc") SimpleArray::__getitem__;
              %feature("python:slot", "sq_item", functype="ssizeargfunc") SimpleArray::__getitem__(Py_ssize_t n);

            will generate closures:

              SWIGPY_SSIZEARGFUNC_CLOSURE(_wrap_SimpleArray___getitem__) /* defines _wrap_SimpleArray___getitem___ssizeargfunc_closure */
              SWIGPY_BINARYFUNC_CLOSURE(_wrap_SimpleArray___getitem__) /* defines _wrap_SimpleArray___getitem___binaryfunc_closure */

            Previously only one name was defined: _wrap_SimpleArray___getitem___closure.
            Hence the overloaded __getitem__ method can be used to support both mp_subscript and sq_item slots.

2016-09-17: wsfulton
            [Python] Fix iterators for containers of NULL pointers (or Python None) when using
            -builtin. Previously iteration would stop at the first element that was NULL.

2016-09-16: olly
            [Javascript] Fix SWIG_exception() macro to return from the current
            function.  Fixes #789, reported by Julien Dutriaux.

2016-09-16: olly
            [PHP] Fix SWIG_exception() macro to return from the current function.
            Fixes #240, reported by Sergey Seroshtan.

2016-09-12: xypron
            [C#] Patch #786 Keyword rename to be CLS compliant by adding an underscore
            suffix instead of an underscore prefix to the C symbol name. Please use an explicit
            %rename to rename the symbol with a _ prefix if you want the old symbol name.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

2016-09-09: olly
            [Python] Fix import handling for Python 2.6 to work in a frozen
            application.  Fixes #145, reported by Thomas Kluyver.

2016-09-02: smarchetto
            [Scilab] Pointers are mapped to mlist instead of tlist
            (mlist better for scilab overloading)

2016-09-02: olly
            [PHP] Fix "out" typemap for member function pointers and "in"
            typemap for char INPUT[ANY].

2016-09-01: wsfulton
            [Python] More efficient Python slicing.
            Call reserve for container types that support it to avoid repeated
            memory reallocations for new slices or slices that grow in size.

2016-09-01: wsfulton
            [Python] #771 - Make builtin types hashable by default.
            Default hash is the underlying C/C++ pointer. This matches up with testing for
            equivalence (Py_EQ in SwigPyObject_richcompare) which compares the pointers.

2016-08-22: wsfulton
            [Python] The following builtin slots can be customized like other slots via the
            "python:<x>" and "python:slot" features where <x> is the appropriate slot name:
              tp_allocs
              tp_bases
              tp_basicsize
              tp_cache
              tp_del
              tp_dealloc
              tp_flags
              tp_frees
              tp_getset
              tp_is_gc
              tp_maxalloc
              tp_methods
              tp_mro
              tp_new
              tp_next
              tp_prev
              tp_richcompare
              tp_subclasses
              tp_weaklist
              was_sq_ass_slice
              was_sq_slice

            A few documentation improvements for slot customization.

2016-08-09: joequant
            [R] Patch #765 Fix extern "C" header includes for C++ code.

2016-08-05: olly
            [xml] Fix how the output filename is built to avoid problems when
            it contains the embedded strings ".c", ".cpp" or ".cxx".
            Fixes #540 reported by djack42.

2016-07-01: wsfulton
            Fix corner case of wrapping std::vector of T pointers where a pointer to a pointer of T
            also exists in the wrapped code. SF Bug 2359417 (967).

2016-06-26: wkalinin
            [Java, C#] Patch #681 Fix seg fault when ignoring nested classes.

2016-06-25: mromberg
            [Python] #711 Fix -castmode and conversion of signed and unsigned integer types.
            See 2015-12-23 CHANGES entry for details of these improvements when they were
            implemented for the default options (ie not using -castmode).

2016-06-25: ahnolds
            Patch #730 - Fix %implicitconv for overloaded functions when using
            -castmode or -fastdispatch options.

            The result is that in all overload cases where there are multiple possibilities
            with the same number of arguments, the dispatch function will first check for
            exact (aka non implicit) matches, and then subsequently check for implicit
            casting matches. This was already happening in the normal dispatch situation,
            and in the -fastdispatch case two passes through the candidates were happening,
            just with SWIG_POINTER_IMPLICIT_CONV always set. After this patch, it is not set
            on the first pass, and then set on the second pass.

2016-06-25: liorgold
            Patch #727 - Add support for C++11 type aliasing.

Version 3.0.10 (12 Jun 2016)
============================

2016-06-06: mromberg
            [Python] Patch #698. Add support for -relativeimport for python 2.7, so -py3 is no
            longer also required for relative import support.

2016-06-05: mromberg
            [Python] Patch #694 - Fix package import regressions introduced in swig-3.0.9.

            1) The code in 3.0.9 did not fall back to 'import _foo' if 'import bar._foo' failed
            (assuming bar.foo was the main module). Every place _foo is imported now first tries
            it from the package where foo was found and if that fails tries _foo as a global module.

            2) The separate block of Python code that injected code to pull in the attributes
            from _foo when -builtin is used made use of the -py3 switch to either do
            'from ._foo import *' or "from _foo import *". This block of code no longer does this
            and instead checks the Python version at runtime to switch between the two syntaxes.

            In summary, swig-3.0.10 has been modified to ease the creation of wrapper modules
            that can be fully made part of a Python package.  SWIG no longer
            assumes the dynamically linked C module is a global module.
            The dynamic module can now be placed into either the same package as the pure Python
            module or as a global module.  Both locations are used by the Python wrapper to
            locate the C module.

            However, this could cause a backwards incompatibility with some code
            that was relying on the ability of "from package import _module" to
            pull attributes out of the package directly.  If your code populates a
            module (which is also a package) with attributes that are SWIG
            generated modules which were not loaded in a conventional way,
            swig-3.0.8 and earlier may have worked due to 'from package import
            _module' bypassing a real import and pulling your module in as an
            attribute. This will no longer work.  Since this is not a common (or
            even recommended) practice, most folk should not be affected.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

2016-05-31: wsfulton
            Fix #690 - Smart pointer to %ignored class doesn't expose inherited methods.
            Regression introduced in swig-3.0.9.

Version 3.0.9 (29 May 2016)
===========================

2016-05-24: mromberg
            [Python] Patch #612 - Add support for Python's implicit namespace packages.

2016-05-23: wsfulton
            [Ruby] Fix #602 - Error handling regression of opaque pointers introduced
            in swig-3.0.8 when C functions explicitly reset a pointer using 'DATA_PTR(self) = 0'.
            An ObjectPreviouslyDeleted error was incorrectly thrown when the pointer was used
            as a parameter.

2016-05-17: tamuratak
            [Ruby] Patch #651 - Correct overloaded function error message when function is
            using %newobject.

2016-05-17: aurelj
            [Ruby] Patch #582 - add support for docstring option in %module()

2016-05-14: wsfulton
            Fix #434 - Passing classes by value as parameters in director methods did not create
            a copy of the argument leading to invalid memory accesses if the object was used
            after the upcall into the target language. Passing arguments by value shouldn't give
            rise to these sorts of memory problems and so the objects are now copied and ownership
            of their lifetime is controlled by the target language.

2016-05-07: wsfulton
            Fix #611. Fix assertion handling defaultargs when using %extend for a template
            class and the extended methods contain default arguments.

            itself ignored.

2016-04-18: ianlancetaylor
	    [Go] Fix use of goout typemap when calling base method by
	    forcing the "type" attribute to the value we need.

2016-04-17: ianlancetaylor
	    [Go] Fixes for Go 1.6: avoid returning Go pointers from
	    directors that return string values; add a trailing 0 byte
	    when treating Go string as C char*.

2016-04-06: smarchetto
            [Scilab] #552 Make Scilab runtime keep track of pointer types
            Instead of a Scilab pointer which has no type, SWIG Scilab maps a
            pointer to a structure tlist containing the pointer adress and its type.

2016-04-02: ahnolds
            [Python] Apply #598. Fix misleading error message when attempting to read a non-existent
            attribute. The previous cryptic error message:
              AttributeError: type object 'object' has no attribute '__getattr__'
            is now replaced with one mentioning the attribute name, eg:
              AttributeError: 'Foo' object has no attribute 'bar'

2016-04-02: derkuci
            [Python] Patch #610 to fix #607.

2016-03-31: wsfulton
            Fixes #594. Fix assertion for some languages when wrapping a C++11 enum class that
            is private in a class.

            Also don't wrap private enums for a few languages that attempted to do so.

2016-03-31: wsfulton
            [Java] unsigned long long marshalling improvements when a negative number
            is passed from Java to C. A cast to signed long long in the C layer will now
            result in the expected value. No change for positive numbers passed to C.
            Fixes #623.

2016-03-22: alexwarg
	    [Lua] #398 Fix lua __getitem + inheritance
            The new handling of classes in Lua (not merging methods into the derived classes)
            breaks for classes that provide a __getitem function. The __getitem function
            prevents method calls to any method defined in a base class. This fix calls
            __getitem only if the member is not found using recursive lookup.

2016-03-18: ptomulik

	    [Java, C#, D] Fix static const char member variables wrappers with %javaconst(1)
            %csconst(1) or %dmanifestconst.
            This fixes the case when an integer is used as the initializer, such as:

              struct W { static const char w = 100; };

	    Fix generated code parsing enum values using char escape sequences
            when these values appear in the Java code (usually when using %javaconst(1))
            such as:

              enum X { x1 = '\n', x2 = '\1' };

            Similarly for static const member char variables such as:

              struct Y { static const char y = '\n'; }

            Likewise for D and %dmanifestconstant. For C# and %csconst(1), char
            values in C# are now hex escaped as C# doesn't support C octal escaping.

2015-12-23: ahnolds
            [Python] Fixes for conversion of signed and unsigned integer types:

            No longer check for PyInt objects in Python3. Because PyInt_Check
            and friends are #defined to the corresponding PyLong methods, this
            had caused errors in Python3 where values greater than what could be
            stored in a long were incorrectly interpreted as the value -1 with
            the Python error indicator set to OverflowError. This applies to
            both the conversions PyLong->long and PyLong->double.

            Conversion from PyLong to long, unsigned long, long long, and
            unsigned long long now raise OverflowError instead of TypeError in
            both Python2 and Python3 for PyLong values outside the range
            expressible by the corresponding C type. This matches the existing
            behavior for other integral types (signed and unsigned ints, shorts,
            and chars), as well as the conversion for PyInt to all numeric
            types. This also indirectly applies to the size_t and ptrdiff_t
            types, which depend on the conversions for unsigned long and long.

            [Ruby] STL ranges and slices fixes.

            Ruby STL container setting slices fixes:

            Setting an STL container wrapper slice better matches the way Ruby
            arrays work. The behaviour is now the same as Ruby arrays. The only
            exception is the default value used when expanding a container
            cannot be nil as this is not a valid type/value for C++ container
            elements.

            Obtaining a Ruby STL container ranges and slices fixes:

            Access via ranges and slices now behave identically to Ruby arrays.
            The fixes are mostly for out of range indices and lengths.
            - Zero length slice requests return an empty container instead of nil.
            - Slices which request a length greater than the size of the container
              no longer chop off the last element.
            - Ranges which used to return nil now return an empty array when the
              the start element is a valid index.

            Ruby STL container negative indexing support improved.

            Using negative indexes to set values works the same as Ruby arrays, eg

            %template(IntVector) std::vector<int>;

            iv = IntVector.new([1,2,3,4])
            iv[-4] = 9 # => [1,2,3,9]
            iv[-5] = 9 # => IndexError

            the full size are supported.

            languages work.

            Any existing code relying on treating signed char* or unsigned
            char* as a string can restore the old behavior with typemaps.i by
            using %apply to copy the [unchanged] char* behavior.

            [Java] Fix potential security exploit in generated Java classes.
            The swigCPtr and swigCMemOwn member variables in the generated Java
            classes are now declared 'transient' by default. Further details of the exploit
            in Android is being published in an academic paper as part of USENIX WOOT '15:
            https://www.usenix.org/conference/woot15/workshop-program/presentation/peles.

            In the unlikely event that you are relying on these members being serializable,
            then you will need to override the default javabody and javabody_derived typemaps
            to generate the old generated code. The relevant typemaps are in the Lib directory
            in the java.swg, boost_shared_ptr.i and boost_intrusive_ptr.i files. Copy the
            relevant default typemaps into your interface file and remove the 'transient' keyword.

            [Python] Fix #475. Improve docstring indentation handling.
            
            SWIG-3.0.5 and earlier sometimes truncated text provided in the docstring feature.
            This occurred when the indentation (whitespace) in the docstring was less in the
            second or later lines when compared to the first line.
            SWIG-3.0.6 gave a 'Line indented less than expected' error instead of truncating
            the docstring text.
            Now the indentation for the 'docstring' feature is smarter and is appropriately
            adjusted so that no truncation occurs.

2015-07-22: wsfulton
            Support for special variable expansion in typemap attributes. Example usage expansion
            in the 'out' attribute (C# specific):

              %typemap(ctype, out="$*1_ltype") unsigned int& "$*1_ltype"

            is equivalent to the following as $*1_ltype expands to 'unsigned int':

              %typemap(ctype, out="unsigned int") unsigned int& "unsigned int"

            Special variables can be used within special variable macros too. Example usage expansion:

              %typemap(cstype) unsigned int "uint"
              %typemap(cstype, out="$typemap(cstype, $*1_ltype)") unsigned int& "$typemap(cstype, $*1_ltype)"

            Special variables are expanded first and hence the above is equivalent to:

              %typemap(cstype, out="$typemap(cstype, unsigned int)") unsigned int& "$typemap(cstype, unsigned int)"

            which then expands to:

              %typemap(cstype, out="uint") unsigned int& "uint"

	    SWIG no longer generates a wrapper for a class' constructor if that class has

            not allow a class to be instantiated if a base has a private destructor. Some
            compilers do, so if you need the old behaviour, use the "notabstract" feature, eg:

              %feature("notabstract") Derived;

	    [Python] Add new feature "python:cdefaultargs" to control default argument
            code generation. By default, SWIG attempts to convert C/C++ default argument values
            into Python values and generates code into the Python layer with these values.
            Recent versions of SWIG are able to convert more of these values, however, the
            new behaviour can be circumvented if desired via this new feature, such that
            the default argument values are obtained from the C layer and not the Python layer.
            For example:

              struct CDA {
                int fff(int a = 1, bool b = false);
              };

            The default code generation in the Python layer is:

              class CDA(_object):
                  ...
                  def fff(self, a=1, b=False):
                      return _default_args.CDA_fff(self, a, b)

            Adding the feature:

              %feature("python:cdefaultargs") CDA::fff;

            Results in:

Version 3.0.0 (16 Mar 2014)
===========================

2014-03-16: wsfulton
            C++11 support initially developed as C++0x support by Matevz Jekovec as a Google Summer of Code
            project has been further extended. The C++11 support is comprehensive, but by no means complete
            or without limitations. Full details for each new feature in C++11 is covered in the
            CPlusPlus11.html chapter in the documentation which is included in SWIG and also available
            online at http://www.swig.org/Doc3.0/CPlusPlus11.html.

2014-03-14: v-for-vandal
            [Lua] Numerous Lua improvements:
            1. %nspace support has been added. Namespaces are mapped to tables in the module, with the same
               name as the C++ namespace.
            2. Inheritance is now handled differently. Each class metatable keeps a list of class bases instead
               of merging all members of all bases into the derived class.
            3. The new metatables result in differences in accessing class members. For example:

                 %module example
                 struct Test {
                     enum { TEST1 = 10, TEST2 = 20 };
                     static const int ICONST = 12;
                 };

                 Now this can be used as follows:
                   print(example.Test.TEST1)
                   print(example.Test.ICONST)
                 The old way was:
                   print(example.Test_TEST1)
                   print(example.Test_ICONST)

            4. The special class metatable member ".constructor" was removed. Now SWIG generates the proxy
               function by itself and assigns it directly to the class table "__call" method.
            5. eLua should also now support inheritance.
            6. 'const' subtable in eLua is considered deprecated.

            Changes in behaviour:
            a. You can no longer assign to non-existing class members in classes without a __setitem__ method.
               It will cause a Lua error.
            b. You can no longer iterate over a module table and copy everything into the global namespace.
               Actually, this was never the case, but it is now explicitly prohibited.
            c. Now changing a base class will immediately affect all derived classes.
            d. There might be some issues with inheritance. Although the bases iteration scheme is the same
               as was used for merging base classes into derived one, some unknown issues may arise.

            The old metatable behaviour can be restored by using the -no-old-metatable-bindings option.

            [Python] Change in default behaviour wrapping C++ bool. Only a Python True or False
            will now work for C++ bool parameters. This fixes overloading bool with other types.
            Python 2.3 minimum is now required for wrapping bool.

            When wrapping:

              const char* overloaded(bool value) { return "bool"; }
              const char* overloaded(int value) { return "int"; }

            Previous behaviour:
              >>> overloaded(False)
              'int'
              >>> overloaded(True)
              'int'
              >>> overloaded(0)
              'int'

            Now we get the expected behaviour:
              >>> overloaded(False)
              'bool'
              >>> overloaded(0)
              'int'

            The consequence is when wrapping bool in non-overloaded functions:

              const char* boolfunction(bool value) { return value ? "true" : "false"; }

            The previous behaviour was very Pythonic:
              >>> boolfunction("")
              'false'
              >>> boolfunction("hi")
              'true'
              >>> boolfunction(12.34)
              'true'
              >>> boolfunction(0)
              'false'
              >>> boolfunction(1)
              'true'

            Now the new behaviour more along the lines of C++ due to stricter type checking. The
            above calls result in an exception and need to be explicitly converted into a bool as
            follows:
              >>> boolfunction(0)
              Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
              TypeError: in method 'boolfunction', argument 1 of type 'bool'
              >>> boolfunction(bool(0))
              'false'

            The old behaviour can be resurrected by passing the -DSWIG_PYTHON_LEGACY_BOOL command line
            parameter when executing SWIG. Typemaps can of course be written to customise the behaviour
            for specific parameters.

            Nested class support added. This primarily allows SWIG to properly parse nested
            classes and keep the nested class information in the parse tree. Java and C#
            have utilised this information wrapping the C++ nested classes as Java/C#
            nested classes. The remaining target languages ignore nested classes as in
            previous versions. Help is needed by users of these remaining languages to
            design how C++ nested classes can be best wrapped. Please talk to us on the
            swig-devel mailing list if you think you can help.

            Previously, there was limited nested class support. Nested classes were treated
            as opaque pointers. However, the "nestedworkaround" feature provided a way to
            wrap a nested class as if it was a global class. This feature no longer exists
            and is replaced by the new "flatnested" feature. This effectively does the same
            thing with less manual code to be written. Please see the 'Nested classes'
            section in the documentation in SWIGPlus.html if you were previously using this
            feature.

            SWIG now parses the contents of nested classes where previously it did not. You
            may find that you will need to make adjustments to your interface file as
            effectively extra code is being wrapped.

            [Python] SF Bug #1297

            Resolve several issues related to python imports.
            For example, it's now possible to import modules having the same module
            names, but belonging in different packages.
            
            From the user's viewpoint, this patch gives a little bit more control on
            import statements generated by SWIG. The user may choose to use relative
            or absolute imports.
            
            Some details:
              - we (still) generate import statements in the form 'import a.b.c' which
                corresponds to absolute imports in python3 and (the only available)
                ambiguous one in python2.
              - added -relativeimport option to use explicit relative import syntax
                (python3),

            The "Python Packages" section in the documentation discusses how to work
            with importing packages including the new -relativeimport command line option.

            it was possible to assign a (non-NUL-terminated) string "hello" to such a buffer before but
            now this fails and only "helo" can fit.

            [Octave] update support to Octave version 3.8.0

            - Octave 3.8.0 no longer defines OCTAVE_API_VERSION_NUMBER, but 3.8.1
              will define OCTAVE_{MAJOR,MINOR,PATCH}_VERSION instead: see
                http://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/rev/b6b6e0dc700e
              So we now use a new macro SWIG_OCTAVE_PREREQ(major,minor,patch) to
              enable features requiring Octave version major.minor.patch or later.

              For Octave versions prior to 3.8.1, we reconstruct values for
              OCTAVE_{MAJOR,MINOR,PATCH}_VERSION based on OCTAVE_API_VERSION_NUMBER,
              extracted from Octave's ChangeLogs. An additional hack is needed to
              distinguish between Octave <= 3.2.x and 3.8.0, neither of which define
              OCTAVE_API_VERSION_NUMBER.

            - Octave 3.8.0 deprecates symbol_table::varref(), so remove its use
              for this and future versions of Octave.

            - Octave 3.8.0 removes octave_value::is_real_nd_array(), used in
              octave_swig_type::dims(). Its use is not required here, so remove it.

            - Retested against Octave versions 3.0.5, 3.2.4, 3.4.3, 3.6.4, and 3.8.0.

            - Updated Octave documentation with tested Octave versions, and added a

            C++11 support for new versions of erase and insert in the STL containers.

            The erase and insert methods in the containers use const_iterator instead
            of iterator in C++11.  There are times when the methods wrapped must match
            the parameters exactly. Specifically when full type information for
            template types is missing or SWIG fails to look up the type correctly,
            for example:

              %include <std_vector.i>
              typedef float Real;
              %template(RealVector) std::vector<Real>;

            SWIG does not find std::vector<Real>::iterator because %template using
            typedefs does not always work and so SWIG doesn't know if the type is
            copyable and so uses SwigValueWrapper<iterator> which does
            not support conversion to another type (const_iterator). This resulted
            in compilation errors when using the C++11 version of the containers.

            [UTL] Infinity is now by default an acceptable value for type 'float'. This fix makes
            the handling of type 'float' and 'double' the same. The implementation requires the
            C99 isfinite() macro, or otherwise some platform dependent equivalents, to be available.

            Users requiring the old behaviour of not accepting infinity, can define a 'check' typemap
            wherever a float is used, such as:

              %typemap(check,fragment="<float.h>") float, const float & %{
                if ($1 < -FLT_MAX || $1 > FLT_MAX) {

            [Lua] Pull Git patch #81: Include Lua error locus in SWIG error messages.  
            This is standard information in Lua error messages, and makes it much

            [Python] %implicitconv is improved for overloaded functions. Like in C++, the methods
            with the actual types are considered before trying implicit conversions. Example:

              %implicitconv A;
              struct A {
                A(int i);
              };
              class CCC {
                public:
                  int xx(int i) { return 11; }
                  int xx(const A& i) { return 22; }
              };

            The following python code:

              CCC().xx(-1)

            will now return 11 instead of 22 - the implicit conversion is not done.

2013-08-07: wsfulton
            [Python] SF Patch #326 from Kris Thielemans - Remove SwigPyObject_print and SwigPyObject_str and
            make the generated wrapper use the default python implementations, which will fall back to repr
            (for -builtin option).

            Advantages:
            - it avoids the swig user having to jump through hoops to get print to work as expected when
              redefining repr/str slots.
            - typing the name of a variable on the python prompt now prints the result of a (possibly redefined)
              repr, without the swig user having to do any extra work.
            - when redefining repr, the swig user doesn't necessarily have to redefine str as it will call the
              redefined repr
            - the behaviour is exactly the same as without the -builtin option while requiring no extra work
              by the user (aside from adding the %feature("python:slot...) statements of course)

            Disadvantage:
            - default str() will give different (but clearer?) output on swigged classes

                static const char *nameDescriptor = "$descriptor(Name)";
              %}

2013-02-19: kwwette
            Fix bug in SWIG's handling of qualified (e.g. const) variables of array type. Given the typedef
              a(7).q(volatile).double myarray     // typedef volatile double[7] myarray;
            the type
              q(const).myarray                    // const myarray
            becomes
              a(7).q(const volatile).double       // const volatile double[7]
            Previously, SwigType_typedef_resolve() produces the type
              q(const).a(7).q(volatile).double    // non-sensical type
            which would never match %typemap declarations, whose types were parsed correctly.
            Add typemap_array_qualifiers.i to the test suite which checks for the correct behaviour.

2013-02-18: wsfulton
            Deprecate typedef names used as constructor and destructor names in %extend. The real
            class/struct name should be used.

              typedef struct tagEStruct {
                int ivar;
              } EStruct;

              %extend tagEStruct {
                EStruct() // illegal name, should be tagEStruct()
                {
                  EStruct *s = new EStruct();
                  s->ivar = ivar0;
                  return s;
                }
                ~EStruct() // illegal name, should be ~tagEStruct()
                {
                  delete $self;
                }
              }

            For now these trigger a warning:

              extend_constructor_destructor.i:107: Warning 522: Use of an illegal constructor name 'EStruct' in
              %extend is deprecated, the constructor name should be 'tagEStruct'.
              extend_constructor_destructor.i:111: Warning 523: Use of an illegal destructor name 'EStruct' in
              %extend is deprecated, the destructor name should be 'tagEStruct'.

            These %extend destructor and constructor names were valid up to swig-2.0.4, however swig-2.0.5 ignored
            them altogether for C code as reported in SF bug #1306. The old behaviour of using them has been
            restored for now, but is officially deprecated. This does not apply to anonymously defined typedef
            classes/structs such as:

              typedef struct {...} X;

2013-02-17: kwwette
            When generating functions provided by %extend, use "(void)" for no-argument functions
            instead of "()". This prevents warnings when compiling with "gcc -Wstrict-prototypes".

2013-02-17: kwwette
            [Octave] Minor fix to autodoc generation: get the right type for functions returning structs.

2013-02-15: wsfulton
            Deprecate typedef names used in %extend that are not the real class/struct name. For example:

              typedef struct StructBName {
                int myint;
              } StructB;

              %extend StructB {
                void method() {}
              }

            will now trigger a warning:

              swig_extend.i:19: Warning 326: Deprecated %extend name used - the struct name StructBName
              should be used instead of the typedef name StructB.

            This is only partially working anyway (the %extend only worked if placed after the class
            definition).

            Fix some feature matching issues for implicit destructors and implicit constructors and implicit
            copy constructors added with %copyctor. Previously a feature for these had to be fully qualified

              struct XXX {};

2012-11-09: wsfulton
            Further consistency in named output typemap lookups for implicit constructors and destructors and
            implicit copy constructors added with %copyctor. Previously only the fully qualified name was being
            used, now the unqualified name will also be used. For example, previously:

              example.i:38: Searching for a suitable 'out' typemap for: void Space::More::~More
                Looking for: void Space::More::~More
                Looking for: void

            Now the unqualified name is also used:

              example.i:38: Searching for a suitable 'out' typemap for: void Space::More::~More
                Looking for: void Space::More::~More
                Looking for: void ~More
                Looking for: void

2012-11-02: wsfulton
            Fix some subtle named output typemap lookup misses, the fully qualified name was not always being

              struct Glob {
                int MyVar;

            Previously the search rules (as shown by -debug-tmsearch) for the getter wrapper were:

                Looking for: int MyVar
                Looking for: int

            Now the scope is named correctly:

              example.i:44: Searching for a suitable 'out' typemap for: int Glob::MyVar
                Looking for: int Glob::MyVar
                Looking for: int MyVar
                Looking for: int

            Fix director typemap searching so that a typemap specified with a name will be correctly matched. Previously
            the name was ignored during the typemap search. Applies to the following list of typemaps: 
            directorout, csdirectorout, cstype, imtype, ctype, ddirectorout, dtype, gotype, jtype, jni, javadirectorout.

            Most of the special variables available for use in %exception are now also available for expansion in
            %extend blocks. These are: $name $symname $overname $decl $fulldecl $parentclassname $parentclasssymname, see docs
            on "Class extension" in SWIGPlus.html. Patch based on submission from Kris Thielemans.

2012-10-10: wsfulton
            Additional new special variables in %exception are expanded as follows:
              $parentclassname - The parent class name (if any) for a method.
              $parentclasssymname - The target language parent class name (if any) for a method.

	    [Go] Generating Go code now requires using the -intgosize option to

              class Derived : public Base<int> {};

            gives the following warning instead of silently ignoring the base:

            cpp_inherit.i:52: Warning 401: Base class 'Base< int >' has no name as it is an empty template instantiated with '%template()'. Ignored.
            cpp_inherit.i:51: Warning 401: The %template directive must be written before 'Base< int >' is used as a base class and be declared with a name.

            [Octave] Prevent Octave from seg-faulting at exit when SWIG
            modules are loaded, due to bugs in Octave's cleanup code:
            * Wrapping functions now declared with Octave DEFUN_DLD macro,
              and loaded through Octave's dynamic module loader
            * Global variables of swigref type are now assigned a new()
              copy of the swigref class, to prevent double-free errors
            * SWIG module at-exit cleanup function now created in Octave
              through eval(), so not dependent on loaded .oct library
            * For Octave versions 3.1.* to 3.3.*, register C-level at-exit
              function which terminates Octave immediately (with correct
              status code) without performing memory cleanup. This function
              can be controlled with macros in Lib/octave/octruntime.swg

            [Octave] New syntax for determing whether SWIG module should be
            loaded globally or non-globally. To load module "example" globally,
            type the module name
            $ example;
            as before; to load module non-globally, assign it to a variable:
            $ example = example;
            or
            $ ex = example;
            for a shorter (local) module name. -global/-noglobal command-line
            options and module command line are deprecated. Added usage info
            to module, so typing
            $ help example
            or incorrect usage should display proper usage, with examples.

            [Python] Add Python stepped slicing support to the STL wrappers (std::vector, std::list).
            Assigning to a slice, reading a slice and deleting a slice with steps now work.
            For example:

            %template(vector_i) std::vector<int>

              vi = vector_i(range(10))
              print list(vi)
              vi[1:4:2] = [111, 333]
              print list(vi)
              del vi[3:10:3]
              print list(vi)
              print list(vi[::-1])

            gives (same behaviour as native Python sequences such as list):

              [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
              [0, 111, 2, 333, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
              [0, 111, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8]
              [8, 7, 5, 4, 2, 111, 0]

            [Python] Fix some indexing bugs in Python STL wrappers when the index is negative, eg:

              iv=vector_i([0,1,2,3,4,5])

            [C#] Provide an easy way to override the default visibility for the proxy class pointer
            constructors and getCPtr() method. The visibility is 'internal' by default and if multiple
            SWIG modules are being used and compiled into different assemblies, then they need to be 
            'public' in order to use the constructor or getCPtr() method from a different assembly.
            Use the following macros to change the visibilities in the proxy and type wrapper class:

              SWIG_CSBODY_PROXY(public, public, SWIGTYPE)
              SWIG_CSBODY_TYPEWRAPPER(public, public, public, SWIGTYPE)

            [Java] Provide an easy way to override the default visibility for the proxy class pointer

            For C code, the fix now results in the use of 'struct A *' instead of just 'B *' in

2011-07-26: wsfulton
            Fix scoping of forward class declarations nested within a class (for C++). Previously the symbol
            was incorrectly put into the outer namespace, eg

            namespace std {
              template<class Key, class T> struct map {
                class iterator;
              };
            }

            iterator was scoped as std::iterator, but now it is correctly std::map<Key, T>::iterator;

            Also fixed is %template and template parameters that are a typedef when the template contains
            default template parameters, eg:

            namespace Std {
              template<class Key, class T, class C = int> struct Map {
                typedef Key key_type;
                typedef T mapped_type;
              };
            }
            typedef double DOUBLE;
            %template(MM) Std::Map<int, DOUBLE>;

            All symbols within Map will be resolved correctly, eg key_type and mapped_type no matter if the
            wrapped code uses Std::Map<int, double> or std::Map<int, DOUBLE> or Std::Map<int, double, int>

            Also fixes bug #3378145 - regression introduced in 2.0.4 - %template using traits.

            in wrappers for classes with many member functions. The patch adds a method hash table to classes and
            changes method name lookup to use the hash table instead of doing a linear search.

Version 2.0.2 (20 February 2011)
================================

2011-02-19: wsfulton

	    can be overridden when building the module by passing
	    -DSWIG_ZEND_ERROR_NORETURN=zend_error to the compiler.  This may
	    result in compiler warnings, but should at least allow a module
	    to be built on those platforms/architectures (SF#3166423).

2011-02-18: wsfulton
            Fix #3184549 - vararg functions and function overloading when using the -fastdispatch option.

2011-02-13: wsfulton
            Fix #1927852 - #include directives don't preprocess the file passed to it. The fix is for
            #include with -importall or -includeall, %include and %import, for example:

2011-02-01: wsfulton
            [C#] Directors - a call to a method being defined in the base class, not
            overridden in a subclass, but again overridden in a class derived from
            the first subclass was not being dispatched correctly to the most derived class.
            See director_alternating.i for an example.

2011-02-01: wsfulton
            [C#, Java] Any 'using' statements in the protected section of a class were previously

            Fix overloading with const pointer reference (SWIGTYPE *const&) parameters for a
            number of scripting languages.

2011-01-17: wsfulton
            New warning for smart pointers if only some of the classes in the inheritance
            chain are marked as smart pointer, eg, %shared_ptr should be used for all classes
            in an inheritance hierarchy, so this new warning highlights code where this is
            not the case.

              example.i:12: Warning 520: Base class 'A' of 'B' is not similarly marked as a smart pointer.
              example.i:16: Warning 520: Derived class 'C' of 'B' is not similarly marked as a smart pointer.

2011-01-14: wsfulton
            Added some missing multi-argument typemaps: (char *STRING, size_t LENGTH) and 
            (char *STRING, int LENGTH). Documentation for this updated. Java patch from

            The situation in which the generated could would previously be
            invalid is illustrated in the new 'director_keywords' test case.

2010-12-23: wsfulton
            [C#] Fix $csinput special variable not being expanded for csvarin typemaps
            when used for global variables. Reported by Vadim Zeitlin.

	    [D] Added the D language module.

2010-11-12: vadz
	    Fix handling of multiple regex-using %renames attached to the same
	    declaration. For example, now

	      %rename("%(regex:/^Set(.*)/put\\1/)s") "";
	      %rename("%(regex:/^Get(.*)/get\\1/)s") "";

	    works as expected whereas before only the last anonymous rename was
	    taken into account.

	    Reported by Frank Vanden Berghen on the SWIG mailing list.

2010-10-12: wsfulton
            Fix unary scope operator (::) (global scope) regression introduced in 2.0.0, reported by
            Ben Walker. The mangled symbol names were incorrect, sometimes resulting in types being
            incorrectly treated as opaque types.

            Also fixes #2958781 and some other type problems due to better typedef resolution, eg 
            std::vector<T *>::value_type didn't resolve to T * when it should have. The mangled type
            was incorrectly SWIGTYPE_std__vectorT_Test_p_std__allocatorT_Test_p_t_t__value_type and now
            it is correctly SWIGTYPE_p_Test.

Version 2.0.1 (4 October 2010)
==============================

2010-10-03: wsfulton
            Apply patch #3066958 from Mikael Johansson to fix default smart pointer

2010-09-24: wsfulton
            More file and line error/warning reporting fixes where SWIG macros
            are used within {} braces (where the preprocessor expands macros),
            for example macros within %inline {...} and %fragment(...) {...}
            and nested structs.

2010-09-18: wsfulton
            More file and line error/warning reporting fixes for various inherited
            class problems.

2010-09-15: wsfulton
            A much improved debugging of SWIG source experience is now available and
            documented in the "Debugging SWIG" section in the Doc/Devel/internals.html
            file, including a swig.dbg support file for the gdb debugger.

2010-09-11: wsfulton
            Fix incorrect line number reporting in errors/warnings when a macro
            definition ends with '/' and it is not the end of a C comment.

2010-09-11: wsfulton
            Fix incorrect line number reporting in errors/warnings after parsing
            macro invocations with parameters given over more than one line.

2010-09-10: wsfulton
            Remove extraneous extra line in preprocessed output after including files
            which would sometimes lead to error/warning messages two lines after the
            end of the file.

2010-09-10: wsfulton
            Fix #2149523 - Incorrect line number reporting in errors after parsing macros
            containing C++ comments.

2010-09-08: olly
	    [PHP] Fix handling of OUTPUT typemaps (Patch from Ryan in SF#3058394).

2010-09-03: wsfulton
            Fix erroneous line numbers in error messages for macro expansions, for example,
            the error message now points to instantiation of the macro, ie the last line here:

              #define MACRO2(a, b) 

              #define MACRO1(NAME) MACRO2(NAME,2,3) 

              MACRO1(abc)

2010-09-02: wsfulton
            Fix line numbers in error and warning messages for preprocessor messages within
            %inline, for example:

              %inline %{
              #define FOOBAR 1
              #define FOOBAR "hi"
              %}

2010-09-02: wsfulton
            Fix line numbers in error and warning messages which were cumulatively one
            less than they should have been after parsing each %include/%import - bug
            introduced in swig-1.3.32. Also fix line numbers in error and warning messages
            when new line characters appear between the %include / %import statement and
            the filename.

2010-08-30: wsfulton
            Fix line number and file name reporting for some macro preprocessor warnings.
            The line number of the macro argument has been corrected and the line number
            of the start of the macro instead of one past the end of the macro is used.
            Some examples:
              file.h:11: Error: Illegal macro argument name '..'
              file.h:19: Error: Macro 'DUPLICATE' redefined,
              file.h:15: Error: previous definition of 'DUPLICATE'.
              file.h:25: Error: Variable-length macro argument must be last parameter
              file.h:32: Error: Illegal character in macro argument name
              file.i:37: Error: Macro 'SIT' expects 2 arguments

2010-08-26: wsfulton
            Fix __LINE__ and __FILE__ expansion reported by Camille Gillot. Mostly this

            Fix make distclean when some of the more obscure languages are detected by
            configure - fixes from Torsten Landschoff.

2010-07-28: wsfulton
            Restore configuring out of source for the test-suite since it broke in 1.3.37.
            As previously, if running 'make check-test-suite' out of source, it needs to be
            done by invoking configure with a relative path. Invoking configure with an
            absolute path will not work. Running the full 'make check' still needs to be
            done in the source tree.

2010-07-16: wsfulton
            Fix wrapping of function pointers and member function pointers when the function
            returns by reference.

2010-07-13: vadz
            Removed support for the old experimental "rxspencer" encoder and
            "[not]rxsmatch" in %rename (see the 01/16/2006 entry). The new and
            officially supported "regex" encoder and "[not]regexmatch" checks
            should be used instead (see the two previous entries). Please
            replace "%(rxspencer:[pat][subst])s" with "%(regex:/pat/subst/)s"
            when upgrading. Notice that you will also need to replace the back-
            references of form "@1" with the more standard "\\1" and may need to
            adjust your regular expressions syntax as the new regex encoder uses
            Perl-compatible syntax and not (extended) POSIX syntax as the old one.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

2010-07-13: vadz
            Add "regexmatch", "regextarget" and "notregexmatch" which can be
            used to apply %rename directives to the declarations matching the
            specified regular expression only. The first two can be used
            interchangeably, both of the %renames below do the same thing:

                %rename("$ignore", regexmatch$name="Old$") "";
                %rename("$ignore", regextarget=1) "Old$";

            (namely ignore the declarations having "Old" suffix).

            "notregexmatch" restricts the match to only the declarations which
            do not match the regular expression, e.g. here is how to rename to
            lower case versions all declarations except those consisting from
            capital letters only:

                %rename("$(lowercase)s", notregexmatch$name="^[A-Z]+$") "";

2010-07-13: vadz
            Add the new "regex" encoder that can be used in %rename, e.g.

                %rename("regex:/(\\w+)_(.*)/\\2/") "";

            to remove any alphabetical prefix from all identifiers. The syntax
            of the regular expressions is Perl-like and PCRE library
            (http://www.pcre.org/) is used to implement this feature but notice
            that backslashes need to be escaped as usual inside C strings.

            Original patch from Torsten Landschoff.

2010-07-08: wsfulton
            Fix #3024875 - shared_ptr of classes with non-public destructors. This also fixes

Version 2.0.0 (2 June 2010)
===========================

2010-06-02: wsfulton
            [C#] Fix SWIG_STD_VECTOR_ENHANCED macro used in std::vector to work with
            types containing commas, for example:

              SWIG_STD_VECTOR_ENHANCED(std::pair< double, std::string >)

2010-06-01: wsfulton
            Add in std_shared_ptr.i for wrapping std::shared_ptr. Requires the %shared_ptr
            macro like in the boost_shared_ptr.i library. std::tr1::shared_ptr can also be
            wrapped if the following macro is defined:

              #define SWIG_SHARED_PTR_SUBNAMESPACE tr1
              %include <std_shared_ptr.i>

            shared_ptr is also documented in Library.html now.

2010-05-27: wsfulton
            Add the ability for $typemap special variable macros to call other $typemap
            special variable macros, for example:

              %typemap(cstype) CC "CC"
              %typemap(cstype) BB "$typemap(cstype, CC)"
              %typemap(cstype) AA "$typemap(cstype, BB)"
              void hah(AA aa);

            This also fixes C# std::vector containers of shared_ptr and %shared_ptr.

            Also added diagnostics for $typemap with -debug-tmsearch, for example, the
            above displays additional diagnostic lines starting "Containing: ":

              example.i:34: Searching for a suitable 'cstype' typemap for: AA aa
                Looking for: AA aa
                Looking for: AA
                Using: %typemap(cstype) AA
                Containing: $typemap(cstype, BB)
              example.i:31: Searching for a suitable 'cstype' typemap for: BB
                Looking for: BB

	    [PHP] When using %throws or %catches, SWIG-generated PHP5 wrappers
	    now throw PHP Exception objects instead of giving a PHP error of
	    type E_ERROR.

	    This change shouldn't cause incompatibility issues, since you can't
	    set an error handler for E_ERROR, so previously PHP would just exit
	    which also happens for unhandled exceptions.  The benefit is you can
	    now catch them if you want to.

	    Fixes SF#2545578 and SF#2955522.

            [C#] Fix #2957375 - SWIGStringHelper and SWIGExceptionHelper not always being
            initialized before use in .NET 4 as the classes were not marked beforefieldinit.
            A static constructor has been added to the intermediary class like this:

              %pragma(csharp) imclasscode=%{
                static $imclassname() {
                }
              %}

            If you had added your own custom static constructor to the intermediary class in
            the same way as above, you will have to modify your approach to use static variable
            initialization or define SWIG_CSHARP_NO_IMCLASS_STATIC_CONSTRUCTOR - See csharphead.swg.

2010-04-01: wsfulton
            Numerous subtle typemap matching rule fixes when using the default type. The typemap
            matching rules are to take a type and find the best default typemap (SWIGTYPE, SWIGTYPE* etc),
            then look for the next best match by reducing the chosen default type. The type deduction
            now follows C++ class template partial specialization matching rules.

            Below are the set of changes made showing the default type deduction
            along with the old reduced type and the new version of the reduced type:

                   SWIGTYPE const &[ANY]
              new: SWIGTYPE const &[]
              old: SWIGTYPE (&)[ANY]

                   SWIGTYPE *const [ANY]
              new: SWIGTYPE const [ANY]
              old: SWIGTYPE *[ANY]

                   SWIGTYPE const *const [ANY]
              new: SWIGTYPE *const [ANY]
              old: SWIGTYPE const *[ANY]

                   SWIGTYPE const *const &
              new: SWIGTYPE *const &
              old: SWIGTYPE const *&

                   SWIGTYPE *const *
              new: SWIGTYPE const *
              old: SWIGTYPE **

                   SWIGTYPE *const &
              new: SWIGTYPE const &
              old: SWIGTYPE *&

            Additionally, a const SWIGTYPE lookup is used now for any constant type. Some examples, where
            T is some reduced type, eg int, struct Foo:

                   T const
              new: SWIGTYPE const
              old: SWIGTYPE

                   T *const
              new: SWIGTYPE *const
              old: SWIGTYPE *

                   T const[]
              new: SWIGTYPE const[]
              old: SWIGTYPE[]

                   enum T const
              new: enum SWIGTYPE const
              old: enum SWIGTYPE

                   T (*const )[]
              new: SWIGTYPE (*const )[]
              old: SWIGTYPE (*)[]

            Reminder: the typemap matching rules can now be seen for any types being wrapped by using
            either the -debug-tmsearch or -debug-tmused options.

            In practice this leads to some subtle matching rule changes and the majority of users
            won't notice any changes, except in the prime area of motivation for this change: Improve
            STL containers of const pointers and passing const pointers by reference. This is fixed
            because many of the STL containers use a type 'T const&' as parameters and when T is 
            a const pointer, for example, 'K const*', then the full type is 'K const*const&'. This
            means that the 'SWIGTYPE *const&' typemaps now match when T is either a non-const or
            const pointer. Furthermore, some target languages incorrectly had 'SWIGTYPE *&' typemaps
            when these should have been 'SWIGTYPE *const&'. These have been corrected (Java, C#, Lua, PHP).

            These are needed in order for the nspace option to work without any other mods.
            The previous default of protected access can be restored using:

              SWIG_JAVABODY_METHODS(protected, protected, SWIGTYPE)

            [C#] Added the nspace feature for C#. Documentation for the nspace feature is now available.

2010-03-04: wsfulton
            Added the nspace feature. This adds some improved namespace support. Currently only Java
            is supported for target languages, where C++ namespaces are automatically translated into
            Java packages. The feature only applies to classes,struct,unions and enums declared within
            a namespace. Methods and variables declared in namespaces still effectively have their
            namespaces flattened. Example usage:

              %feature(nspace) Outer::Inner1::Color;
              %feature(nspace) Outer::Inner2::Color;

              namespace Outer {
                namespace Inner1 {
                  struct Color {
                    ...
                  };
                }
                namespace Inner2 {
                  struct Color {
                    ...
                  };
                }
              }

            For Java, the -package option is also required when using the nspace feature. Say
            we use -package com.myco, the two classes can then be accessed as follows from Java:

              com.myco.Outer.Inner1.Color and com.myco.Outer.Inner2.Color.

2009-11-12: wsfulton
            Fix usage of nested template classes so that compilable code is generated - the nested
            template class is now treated like a normal nested classes, that is, as an opaque type
            unless the nestedworkaround feature is used.

2009-11-12: wsfulton
            Replace SWIGWARN_PARSE_NESTED_CLASS with SWIGWARN_PARSE_NAMED_NESTED_CLASS and
            SWIGWARN_PARSE_UNNAMED_NESTED_CLASS for named and unnamed nested classes respectively.

            Named nested class ignored warnings can now be suppressed by name using %warnfilter, eg:

              %warnfilter(SWIGWARN_PARSE_NAMED_NESTED_CLASS) Outer::Inner;

            but clearly unnamed nested classes cannot and the global suppression is still required, eg:

              #pragma SWIG nowarn=SWIGWARN_PARSE_UNNAMED_NESTED_CLASS

2009-11-11: wsfulton
            Added the nestedworkaround feature as a way to use the full functionality of a nested class 
            (C++ mode only). It removes the nested class from SWIG's type information so it is as if SWIG
            had never parsed the nested class. The documented nested class workarounds using a global
            fake class stopped working when SWIG treated the nested class as an opaque pointer, and
            this feature reverts this behaviour. The documentation has been updated with details of how
            to use and implement it, see the "Nested classes" section in SWIGPlus.html.

2009-11-11: wsfulton
            There were a number of C++ cases where nested classes/structs/unions were being handled
            as if C code was being parsed which would oftentimes lead to uncompilable code as an
            attempt was made to wrap the nested structs like it is documented for C code. Now all
            nested structs/classes/unions are ignored in C++ mode, as was always documented. However,
            there is an improvement as usage of nested structs/classes/unions is now always treated
            as an opaque type by default, resulting in generated code that should always compile.

2009-11-08: wsfulton
            Fix inconsistency for nested structs/unions/classes. Uncompilable code was being
            generated when inner struct and union declarations were used as types within the
            inner struct. The inner struct/union is now treated as a forward declaration making the
            behaviour the same as an inner class. (C++ code), eg:

              struct Outer {
                struct InnerStruct { int x; };
                InnerStruct* getInnerStruct();

            and bug #1816802 - SwigValueWrapper should be used:

              ::CC x();

              template <typename T> struct X { void a() {} };
              template <> struct X<S> { void b() {} };
              %template(MyTConcrete) X< ::S >;

            plus probably some other corner case usage of ::.

2009-10-20: wsfulton
	    Fixed previously fairly poor template partial specialization and explicit 
            specialization support. Numerous bugs in this area have been fixed including:

            - Template argument deduction implemented for template type arguments, eg this now
              works:
                template<typename T> class X      {};
                template<typename T> class X<T *> {};
                %template(X1) X<const int *>; // Chooses T * specialization

              and more complex cases with multiple parameters and a mix of template argument
              deduction and explicitly specialised parameters, eg:
                template <typename T1, typename T2> struct TwoParm               { void a() {} };
                template <typename T1>              struct TwoParm<T1 *, int *>  { void e() {} };
                %template(E) TwoParm<int **, int *>;

            Note that the primary template must now be in scope, like in C++, when
            an explicit or partial specialization is instantiated with %template.

	    [Ruby] Fix #2676738 SWIG generated symbol name clashes.

2009-03-01: bhy
            [Python] Some fixes for Python 3.0.1 and higher support. In 3.0.1, the C API function
            PyObject_Compare is removed, so PyObject_RichCompareBool is used for replacement.
            Struct initilization of SwigPyObject and SwigPyObject_as_number changed to reflect
            the drop of tp_compare and nb_long.

2009-03-01: bhy
            [Python] Fix SF#2583160. Now the importer in Python shadow wrapper take care of the
            case that module already imported at other place.

2009-02-28: bhy
            [Python] Fix SF#2637352. Move struct declaration of SWIG_module in pyinit.swg before
            the method calls, since some C compiler don't allow declaration in middle of function
            body.

	    [Allegrocl] Fix seg fault wrapping some constant variable (%constant) types.

2009-02-20: wsfulton
	    [CFFI] Fix seg faults when for %extend and using statements.

2009-02-20: wsfulton
	    Fix SF #2605955: -co option which broke in 1.3.37. 

2009-02-20: wsfulton
	    New %insert("begin") section added. Also can be used as %begin. This is a new
	    code section reserved entirely for users and the code within the section is generated
	    at the top of the C/C++ wrapper file and so provides a means to put custom code
	    into the wrapper file before anything else that SWIG generates.

2009-02-17: wsfulton
	    'make clean-test-suite' will now run clean on ALL languages. Previously it only
	    ran the correctly configured languages. This way it is now possible to clean up
	    properly after running 'make partialcheck-test-suite'.

2009-02-14: wsfulton
	    Extend attribute library support for structs/classes and the accessor functions use
	    pass/return by value semantics. Two new macros are available and usage is identical
	    to %attribute. These are %attributeval for structs/classes and %attributestring for
	    string classes, like std::string. See attribute.swg for more details.

2009-02-13: wsfulton
	    Add support for %extend and memberin typemaps. Previously the memberin typemaps were
	    ignored for member variables within a %extend block.

2009-02-12: wsfulton
	    Remove unnecessary temporary variable when wrapping return values that are references. 
	    Example of generated code for wrapping:

	      struct XYZ {
		std::string& refReturn();
	      };

	    used to be:

              std::string *result = 0 ;
              ...
              {
                std::string &_result_ref = (arg1)->refReturn();
                result = (std::string *) &_result_ref;
              }

	     Now it is:

              std::string *result = 0 ;
              ...
              result = (std::string *) &(arg1)->refReturn();

2009-01-31: bhy
            [Python] Fix SF#2552048 reported by Gaetan Lehmann. The parameter list

2009-01-29: wsfulton
	    Fix regression introduced in 1.3.37 where the default output directory
	    for target language specific files (in the absence of -outdir) was no

2009-01-10: wsfulton
	    Patch  #1992756 from Colin McDonald - %contract not working for classes 
	    in namespace

2009-01-05: olly
	    Mark SWIGPERL5, SWIGPHP5, and SWIGTCL8 as deprecated in the source
	    code and remove documentation of them.

2008-12-30: wsfulton
	    Bug #2430756. All the languages now define a macro in the generated C/C++
	    wrapper file indicating which language is being wrapped. The macro name is the
	    same as those defined when SWIG is run, eg SWIGJAVA, SWIGOCTAVE, SWIGCSHARP etc
	    and are listed in the "Conditional Compilation" section in the documentation.

2008-12-23: wsfulton
	    [Java] Fix #2153773 - %nojavaexception was clearing the exception feature
            instead of disabling it. Clearing checked Java exceptions also didn't work. 
	    The new %clearjavaexception can be used for clearing the exception feature.

2008-12-22: wsfulton
	    Fix #2432801 - Make SwigValueWrapper exception safe for when copy constructors
	    throw exceptions.

2008-12-21: wsfulton
	    Apply patch #2440046 which fixes possible seg faults for member and global
	    variable char arrays when the strings are larger than the string array size.

2008-12-20: wsfulton
	    The ccache compiler cache has been adapted to work with SWIG and
	    named ccache-swig. It now works with C/C++ compilers as well as SWIG
	    and can result in impressive speedups when used to recompile unchanged
	    code with either a C/C++ compiler or SWIG. Documentation is in CCache.html
	    or the installed ccache-swig man page.

2008-12-12: wsfulton
	    Apply patch from Kalyanov Dmitry which fixes parsing of nested structs

2008-12-06: wsfulton
	    [PHP] Deprecate %pragma(php4). Please use %pragma(php) instead.
	    The following two warnings have been renamed:
	    WARN_PHP4_MULTIPLE_INHERITANCE -> WARN_PHP_MULTIPLE_INHERITANCE
	    WARN_PHP4_UNKNOWN_PRAGMA       -> WARN_PHP_UNKNOWN_PRAGMA

2008-12-04: bhy
            [Python] Applied patch SF#2158938: all the SWIG symbol names started with Py
            are changed, since they are inappropriate and discouraged in Python
            documentation (from http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/api/includes.html):

            "All user visible names defined by Python.h (except those defined by
            the included standard headers) have one of the prefixes "Py" or "_Py".
            Names beginning with "_Py" are for internal use by the Python implementation
            and should not be used by extension writers. Structure member names do
            not have a reserved prefix.

            Important: user code should never define names that begin with "Py" or "_Py".
            This confuses the reader, and jeopardizes the portability of the user
            code to future Python versions, which may define additional names beginning
            with one of these prefixes."

            Here is a brief list of what changed:

                PySwig* -> SwigPy*
                PyObject_ptr -> SwigPtr_PyObject
                PyObject_var -> SwigVar_PyObject
                PySequence_Base, PySequence_Cont, PySequence_Ref ->
                        SwigPySequence_Base, SwigPySequence_Cont, SwigPySequence_Ref
                PyMap* -> SwigPyMap*

            We provided a pyname_compat.i for backward compatibility. Users whose code having
            these symbols and do not want to change it could simply include this file
            at front of your code. A better solution is to run the converting tool on
            your code, which has been put in SWIG's SVN trunk (Tools/pyname_patch.py) and
            you can download it here:
            https://swig.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/swig/trunk/Tools/pyname_patch.py 

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

2008-12-02: wsfulton
	    [Python] Apply patch #2143727 from Serge Monkewitz to fix importing base classes 
	    when the package option is specified in %module and that module is %import'ed.

2008-11-28: wsfulton
	    [UTL] Fix #2080497. Some incorrect acceptance of types in the STL, eg a double * element
	    passed into a vector<int *> constructor would be accepted, but the ensuing behaviour
	    was undefined. Now the type conversion correctly raises an exception.

2008-11-24: wsfulton
	    Add -outcurrentdir option. This sets the default output directory to the current 
	    directory instead of the path specified by the input file. This option enables
	    behaviour similar to c/c++ compilers. Note that this controls the output directory,
	    but only in the absence of the -o and/or -outdir options.

2008-11-23: wsfulton
	    [ruby] Apply patch #2263850 to fix ruby/file.i ... rubyio.h filename change in 
	    ruby 1.9.

2008-11-23: wsfulton
	    Apply patch #2319790 from Johan Hake to fix shared_ptr usage in std::tr1 namespace.

2008-11-21: wsfulton
	    The use of the include path to find the input file is now deprecated.
	    This makes the behaviour of SWIG the same as C/C++ compilers in preparation
	    for use with ccache.

2008-11-16: wsfulton
	    Fix -nopreprocess option to:
	    - correctly report file names in warning and error messages.
	    - use the original input filename that created the preprocessed output when 
	      determining the C++ wrapper file name (in the absence of -o). Previously 
	      the name of the input file containing the preprocessed output was used.

2008-11-11: wsfulton
	    [Java] Add patch #2152691 from MATSUURA Takanori which fixes compiles using the

            Add patch #2128249 from Anatoly Techtonik which corrects the C/C++ proxy
            class being reported for Python docstrings when %rename is used.

2008-11-01: wsfulton
            Add the strip encoder patch from Anatoly Techtonik #2130016. This enables an 
            easy way to rename symbols by stripping a commonly used prefix in all the
            function/struct names. It works in the same way as the other encoders, such as
            title, lower, command etc outlined in CHANGES file dated 12/30/2005. Example
            below will rename wxAnotherWidget to AnotherWidget and wxDoSomething to 
            DoSomething:

              %rename("%(strip:[wx])s") ""; 

              struct wxAnotherWidget {
                  void wxDoSomething();

	    Lots of test-suite work.
	    - Fix ordering of wrapper output and %{ %} header output.
	    - Fix declarations of local vars in C wrappers.
	    - Fix declaration of defined constants in C wrappers.
	    - Fix declaration of EnumValues in C wrappers.
	    - add some const typemaps to allegrocl.swg
	    - add rename for operator bool() overloads.
	
2008-09-25: olly
	    [PHP5] Fill in typemaps for SWIGTYPE and void * (SF#2095186).

2008-09-22: mutandiz (Mikel Bancroft)
	    [allegrocl]
	    - Support wrapping of types whose definitions are not seen by
	    SWIG. They are treated as forward-referenced classes and if a
	    definition is not seen are treated as (* :void).
	    - Don't wrap the contents of unnamed namespaces.
	    - More code cleanup. Removed some extraneous warnings.
	    - start work on having the allegrocl mod pass the cpp test-suite.

2008-09-19: olly
	    [PHP5] Add typemaps for long long and unsigned long long.

2008-09-18: wsfulton
            [C#] Added C# array typemaps provided by Antti Karanta.
            The arrays provide a way to use MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPArray)
            and pinning the array using 'fixed'. See arrays_csharp.i library file
            for details.

2008-09-18: wsfulton
	    Document the optional module attribute in the %import directive,
            see Modules.html. Add a warning for Python wrappers when the
            module name for an imported base class is missing, requiring the
            module attribute to be added to %import, eg 

              %import(module="FooModule") foo.h

2008-09-18: olly
	    [PHP5] Change the default input typemap for char * to turn PHP
	    Null into C NULL (previously it was converted to an empty string).
	    The new behaviour is consistent with how the corresponding output
	    typemap works (SF#2025719).

	    If you want to keep the old behaviour, add the following typemap
	    to your interface file (PHP's convert_to_string_ex() function does
	    the converting from PHP Null to an empty string):

	    %typemap(in) char * {
		convert_to_string_ex($input);
		$1 = Z_STRVAL_PP($input);
	    }

2008-09-18: olly
	    [PHP5] Fix extra code added to proxy class constructors in the case
	    where the only constructor takes no arguments.

2008-09-18: olly
	    [PHP5] Fix wrapping of a renamed enumerated value of an enum class
	    member (SF#2095273).

2008-09-17: mutandiz (Mikel Bancroft)
	    [allegrocl]
	    - Fix how forward reference typedefs are handled, so as not to conflict
	    with other legit typedefs.
	    - Don't (for now) perform an ffitype typemap lookup when trying to
	    when calling compose_foreign_type(). This is actually a useful thing
	    to do in certain cases, the test cases for which I can't currently
	    locate :/. It's breaking some wrapping behavior that is more commonly
	    seen, however. I'll readd in a more appropriate way when I can
	    recreate the needed test case, or a user complains (which means
	    they probably have a test case).
	    - document the -isolate command-line arg in the 'swig -help' output.
	    It was in the html docs, but not there.
	    - small amount of code cleanup, removed some unused code.
	    - some minor aesthetic changes.

2008-09-12: bhy
            [Python] Python 3.0 support branch merged into SWIG trunk. Thanks to
            Google Summer of Code 2008 for supporting this project! By default
            SWIG will generate interface files compatible with both Python 2.x
            and 3.0. And there's also some Python 3 new features that can be
            enabled by passing a "-py3" command line option to SWIG. These
            features are:

              - Function annotation support
                  Also, the parameter list of proxy function will be generated,
                  even without the "-py3" option. However, the parameter list
                  will fallback to *args if the function (or method) is overloaded.
              - Buffer interface support
              - Abstract base class support

            For details of Python 3 support and these features, please see the
            "Python 3 Support" section in the "SWIG and Python" chapter of the SWIG
            documentation.

            The "-apply" command line option and support of generating codes
            using apply() is removed. Since this is only required by very old
            Python.

            This merge also patched SWIG's parser to solve a bug. By this patch,
            SWIG features able to be correctly applied on C++ conversion operator,
            such like this:
              
              %feature("shadow")  *::operator bool %{ ... %}

            [C#] Support for 'using' and 'fixed' blocks in the 'csin' typemap is now
            possible through the use of the pre attribute and the new terminator attribute, eg

              %typemap(csin, 
                       pre="    using (CDate temp$csinput = new CDate($csinput)) {",
                       terminator="    } // terminate temp$csinput using block",
                      ) const CDate &
                       "$csclassname.getCPtr(temp$csinput)"

            [Java, C#] C# and Java keywords will be renamed instead of just issuing a warning
            and then generating uncompilable code. Warning 314 gives the new name when a

            New partialcheck makefile targets for partial testing of the test-suite. These
            just invoke SWIG, ie no compilation and no runtime testing. It can be faster
            when developing by just doing a directory diff of the files SWIG generates
            against those from a previous run. Example usage from the top level directory:

              make partialcheck-test-suite
              make partialcheck-java-test-suite

            This change also encompasses more flexibility in running the test-suite, eg
            it is possible to prefix the command line which runs any target language test
            with a tool. See the RUNTOOL, COMPILETOOL and SWIGTOOL targets in the common.mk
            file and makefiles in the test-suite directory. For example it is possible to 
            run the runtime tests through valgrind using:

              make check RUNTOOL="valgrind --leak-check=full"

            or invoke SWIG under valgrind using:

              make check SWIGTOOL="valgrind --tool=memcheck"

            This patch mirrors the gcc -MT option which allows one to change the default
            Makefile target being generated when generating makefiles with the -M family
            of options. For example:

                          the overloaded method
              $decl     - the fully qualified C/C++ declaration of the method being wrapped 
                          without the return type

02/10/2008: wsfulton
            Bump SWIG_RUNTIME_VERSION to 4. This is because of the recently introduced API 
            change in the conversion functions, ie change in definition of swig_converter_func.
            Anyone calling SWIG_TypeCast must pass in a valid value for the new additional
            (third) parameter and then handle the newly created memory if the returned value
            is set to SWIG_CAST_NEW_MEMORY else a memory leak will ensue.

02/09/2008: wsfulton
            [Python] Experimental shared_ptr typemaps added. Usage is the same as the recently
            added Java and C# shared_ptr typemaps. Two macros are available, although these
            may well change in a future version:

            For base classes or classes not in an inheritance chain:
              SWIG_SHARED_PTR(PROXYCLASS, TYPE)
            For derived classes:
              SWIG_SHARED_PTR_DERIVED(PROXYCLASS, BASECLASSTYPE, TYPE)

            The PROXYCLASS is the name of the proxy class, but is only required for Java/C#.
            Example usage:

              %include "boost_shared_ptr.i"

              SWIG_SHARED_PTR(Klass, Space::Klass)
              SWIG_SHARED_PTR_DERIVED(KlassDerived, Space::Klass, Space::KlassDerived)

              namespace Space {
                struct Klass { ... };
                struct KlassDerived : Klass { ... };
              }

            Further details to follow in future documentation, but the following features
            should be noted:

            - Not restricted to boost::shared_ptr, eg std::tr1::shared_ptr can also be used.
            - Available typemap groups:
              (a) Typemaps for shared_ptr passed by value, reference, pointer and pointer 
                  reference.
            - (b) Typemaps for passing by raw value, raw pointer, raw reference, raw pointer
                  reference. 
            - The code being wrapped does not even have to use shared_ptr, SWIG can use
              shared_ptr as the underlying storage mechanism instead of a raw pointer due to 
              the typemaps in group (b) above.
            - No array support as shared_ptr does not support arrays.
            - This works quite differently to the usual SWIG smart pointer support when
              operator-> is parsed by SWIG:
              - An additional smart pointer class is not generated reducing code bloat in
                the wrappers.
              - Using smart pointers and raw pointers can be mixed seamlessly.
              - Missing constructors for the smart pointers is no longer a problem and so
                separate factory type functions do not have to be written and wrapped.
              - The implicit C++ shared_ptr< derived class > to shared_ptr< base class >
                cast also works in the target language. This negates the necessity to write
                an explicit helper cast function providing the upcast which would need
                calling prior to passing a derived class to a method taking a shared_ptr to
                a base class.

02/09/2008: wsfulton
            [Python] Add support for overriding the class registration function via a new
            "smartptr" feature. This is a very low level of customisation most users
            would never need to know. The feature will typically be used for intrusive 
            smart pointers along with additional typemaps. Example usage of the feature:

              %feature("smartptr", noblock=1) Foo { boost::shared_ptr< Foo > }
              class Foo {};

            The generated Foo_swigregister function will then register boost::shared < Foo >
            (SWIGTYPE_p_boost__shared_ptrTFoo_t instead of SWIGTYPE_p_Foo) as the underlying
            type for instantiations of Foo.

02/09/2008: wsfulton
            Features now supports the optional 'noblock' attribute for all usage of %feature. 
            When specified, the { } braces are removed from the feature code. This is identical
            in behaviour to usage of 'noblock' in typemaps and is used when the preprocessor
            is required to operate on the code in the feature and the enclosing { } braces
            are not required. Example:

              #define FOO foo
              %feature("smartptr", noblock="1") { FOO::bar }

            The preprocessor then reduces this as if this had been used instead:

              %feature("smartptr") "foo::bar"

02/01/2008: olly
	    [Python] Fix format string bug (SF#1882220).

01/31/2008: wsfulton
            Additions to the %types directive. Now the conversion / casting code can be
            overridden to some custom code in the %types directive, like so:

              %types(fromtype = totype) %{
                ... code to convert fromtype to totype and return ...
              %}

            The special variable $from will be replaced by the name of the parameter of the
            type being converted from. The code must return the totype cast to void *. Example:

              class Time;
              class Date;
              Date &Time::dateFromTime();

              %types(Time = Date) %{
                Time *t = (Time *)$from;
                Date &d = t->dateFromTime();
                return (void *) &d;
              %}

            resulting in the conversion / casting code looking something like:

              static void *_p_TimeTo_p_Date(void *x) {
                Time *t = (Time *)x;
                Date &d = t->dateFromTime();
                return (void *) &d;
              }

            This is advanced usage, please use only if you understand the runtime type system.

	    [Python] For STL containers, SWIG no longer attempts to convert from one
            STL container to another, eg from std::vector<int> to std::vector<double>
            or std::list<int> to std::vector<int> or even std::vector<Foo> to
            std::vector<Bar> as it previously did. In fact SWIG no longer attempts to
            convert any SWIG wrapped C++ proxy class that is also a Python sequence,
            whereas previously it would. Any non-SWIG Python sequence will still be
            accepted wherever an STL container is accepted. Overloaded methods using
            containers should be faster.

              struct Derived : Base {
                virtual void funk();
                using Base::funk;
              };

Version 1.3.32 (November 15, 2007)
==================================

11/14/2007: wsfulton
            [R] Package name and dll name is now the same as the SWIG module
            name. It used to be the module name with _wrap as a suffix. The package
            and dll names can be modified using the -package and -dll commandline
            options.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

11/11/2007: wsfulton
            [R] Add support for Windows (Visual C++ 8 tested)

11/10/2007: olly
	    [php] Fix makefile generated by -make (SF#1633679).  Update
	    documentation to mark "-make" as deprecated (none of the other
	    SWIG backends seem to offer such a feature, it can't realistically
	    generate a fully portable makefile, and the commands to build an
	    extension are easy enough to write for the user's preferred build
	    tool).  Also recommend against the use of "-phpfull" (it's only
	    really useful when static linking, and a dynamically loadable
	    module is virtually always the better approach).

11/09/2007: olly
	    Fix --help output to note that `export SWIG_FEATURES' is required.

10/29/2007: wsfulton
            [R] Fix seg fault on Windows

	    and template_specialization_defarg to fail.
	    Added several warning filters into the overload's test cases.
	    Added runtime tests for several codes.
	    You can now make check-lua-test-suite with no errors and only a few warnings.

10/30/2007: olly
	    [guile] Fix the configure test to put GUILELINK in LIBS not LDFLAGS
	    (SF#1822430).

10/30/2007: olly
	    [guile] Fix the guile examples on 64-bit platforms.

	    SWIG wrappers to be compiled into the same executable statically.
	    Patch from Andreas Fredriksson (posted to the swig mailing list).

10/28/2007: olly
	    [lua] Fix Examples/lua to pass SRCS for C tests rather than CXXSRCS.
	    The code as it was happened to work on x86, but broke on x86_64 (and
	    probably any other platforms which require -fPIC).

10/28/2007: wsfulton
            [Java, C#] New approach for fixing uninitialised variable usage on error in director
            methods using the new templated initialisation function SwigValueInit().

10/28/2007: wsfulton
            [Perl] Use more efficient SvPV_nolen(x) instead of SvPV(x,PL_na) if SvPV_nolen is

	    char[] (SF#1820132).

10/22/2007: mkoeppe
	    [Guile] Filter out -ansi -pedantic from CFLAGS while compiling test programs for Guile

	    usable.

10/22/2007: mkoeppe

10/19/2007: wsfulton
            [Java, C#] Bug #1794247 - fix generated code for derived classes when csbase or javabase
            typemaps are used with the replace="1" attribute.

10/19/2007: wsfulton
            [Python] Docs updated to suggest using distutils. Patch #1796681 from Christopher Barker.

10/19/2007: olly
	    [perl5] Clear errno before calls to strtol(), strtoul(), strtoll()
	    and strtoull() which we check errno after to avoid seeing a junk
	    value of errno if there isn't an error in the call.

10/16/2007: wsfulton
            Deprecate %attribute_ref and replace with %attributeref. There is just an argument
            order change in order to maintain consistency with %attribute, from:

              %attribute_ref(Class, AttributeType, AccessorMethod, AttributeName)
            to
              %attributeref(Class, AttributeType, AttributeName, AccessorMethod)

10/16/2007: olly
	    [Tcl] Fix several occurrences of "warning: deprecated conversion
	    from string constant to 'char*'" from GCC 4.2 in generated C/C++
	    code.

10/16/2007: olly
	    [PHP] Fix many occurrences of "warning: deprecated conversion from
	    string constant to 'char*'" from GCC 4.2 in generated C/C++ code
	    when compiling with a new enough version of PHP 5 (tested with
	    PHP 5.2.3, but PHP 5.2.1 is probably the minimum requirement).

10/15/2007: wsfulton
            Patch #1797133 from David Piepgrass fixes %attribute when the getter has the same name
            as the attribute name and no longer generate non-functional setter for read-only attributes.

10/15/2007: olly
	    [Tcl] Prevent SWIG_Tcl_ConvertPtr from calling the unknown proc.
	    Add Examples/tcl/std_vector/ which this change fixes.  Patch
	    is from "Cliff C" in SF#1809819.

10/12/2007: wsfulton
            [Java] Add DetachCurrentThread back in for directors. See entry dated 08/11/2006 and
            search for DetachCurrentThread on the mailing lists for details. The crashes on Solaris
            seem to be only present in jdk-1.4.2 and lower (jdk-1.5.0 and jdk-1.6.0 are okay), so
            anyone using directors should use a recent jdk on Solaris, or define (see director.swg)
            SWIG_JAVA_NO_DETACH_CURRENT_THREAD to the C++ compiler to get old behaviour.

10/12/2007: wsfulton
	    [Java] Ensure the premature garbage collection prevention parameter (pgcpp) is generated
            when there are C comments in the jtype and jstype typemaps.

10/12/2007: wuzzeb
	    Added a testsuite entry for Bug #1735931

10/09/2007: olly
	    Automatically rerun autogen.sh if configure.in is modified.

10/09/2007: olly
	    Enhance check-%-test-suite rule and friends to give a more helpful
	    error message if you try them for a language which doesn't exist
	    (e.g. "make check-php-test-suite" rather than the correct
	    "make check-php4-test-suite").

10/09/2007: olly
	    Add make rule to regenerate Makefile from Makefile.in if it has
	    changed.

10/09/2007: olly
	    [php] Fix long-standing memory leak in wrapped constructors and
	    wrapped functions/methods which return an object.

	    build.

10/07/2007: wsfulton
            [C#, Java] Experimental shared_ptr typemaps added

09/27/2007: mgossage
	    [lua] added more verbose error messages for incorrect typechecks.
	    Added a routine which checks the exact number of parameters passed to a function
	    (breaks operator_overloading for unary minus operator, currently disabled).
	    Reorganised the luatypemaps.swg to tidy it up.
	    Added a lot of %ignores on the operators not supported by lua.
	    Added support for constant member function pointers & runtest for member_pointer.i
	    Added first version of wchar.i

09/25/2007: wsfulton
            [C#, Java] throws typemaps for std::wstring using C# patch #1799064 from David Piepgrass

09/24/2007: wsfulton
            [Tcl] Apply #1771313 to fix bug #1650229 - fixes long long and unsigned long long
            handling.

09/20/2007: olly
	    [Java] Eliminate some unnecessary uses of a temporary buffer
	    allocated using new[].  SF#1796609.

09/19/2007: wsfulton
            [C#] The $csinput special variable can be used in the csvarin typemap where it is always
            expanded to 'value'.

09/19/2007: wsfulton
            [C#] Fix bug reported by Glenn A Watson and #1795260 where the cstype typemap used the 'ref'
            keyword in the typemap body, it produced uncompilable C# properties (variable wrappers).
            The type for the property now correctly comes from the 'out' attribute in the cstype typemap.

09/19/2007: wsfulton
            [Java] Fix const std::wstring& typemaps

09/19/2007: wsfulton
	    [Java] Ensure the premature garbage collection prevention parameter (pgcpp) is generated
            where a parameter is passed by pointer reference, eg in the std::vector wrappers. The pgcpp
            is also generated now when user's custom typemaps use a proxy class in the jstype typemap
            and a 'long' in the jtype typemap.

09/18/2007: olly
	    [php] Add typemaps for handling parameters of type std::string &
	    which are modified by the wrapped function.

09/17/2007: olly
	    [python] Split potentially long string literals to avoid hitting
	    MSVC's low fixed limit on string literal length - patch from
	    SF#1723770, also reported as SF#1630855.

09/17/2007: olly
	    [ocaml] Fix renaming of overloaded methods in the method_table -
	    my patch from SF#940399.

09/17/2007: olly
	    [python] Simpler code for SWIG_AsVal_bool() which fixes a "strict
	    aliasing" warning from GCC - patch from SF#1724581 by Andrew
	    Baumann.

09/17/2007: olly
	    [perl5] Use sv_setpvn() to set a scalar from a pointer and length
	    - patch from SF#174460 by "matsubaray".

09/17/2007: olly
	    When wrapping C++ code, generate code which uses
	    std::string::assign(PTR, LEN) rather than assigning
	    std::string(PTR, LEN).  Using assign generates more efficient code
	    (tested with GCC 4.1.2).

09/07/2007: wsfulton
	    Fix %ignore on constructors which are not explicitly declared [SF #1777712]

09/05/2007: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
	    - Change r_ltype in typesys.c to store a hashtable instead of a single value.
	      several very subtle bugs were being caused by multiple ltypes being mapped
	      to a single mangled type, mostly when using typedefed template parameters.
	      Now, r_ltype stores a hashtable of possible ltypes, and when generating the
	      type table, all the ltypes are added into the swig_type_info structure.

08/31/2007: wsfulton
            SF #1754967 from James Bigler.
            - Fix bug in turning on warnings that were turned off by default. Eg 'swig -w+309' will now
              turn on the normally suppressed warning 309.

            - New -Wextra commandline option which enables the extra warning numbers:
              202,309,403,512,321,322 (this is the list of warnings that have always been suppressed by
              default). By specifying -Wextra, all warnings will be turned on, but unlike -Wall,
              warnings can still be selectively turned on/off using %warnfilter,
              #pragma SWIG nowarn or further -w commandline options, eg:
                swig -Wextra -w309
              will turn on all warnings except 309.

08/28/2007: wsfulton
            - New debugging options, -debug-module <n> and -debug-top <n> to display the parse tree at
              various stages, where <n> is a comma separated list of stages 1-4.For example, to
              display top of parse tree at stages 1 and 3:
                swig -debug-top 1,3

            - Deprecate the following options which have equivalents below:
              -dump_parse_module    =>   -debug-module 1
              -dump_module          =>   -debug-module 4
              -dump_parse_top       =>   -debug-top 1
              -dump_top             =>   -debug-top 4

            - Renamed some commandline options for naming consistency across all options:
              -debug_template  =>   -debug-template
              -debug_typemap   =>   -debug-typemap
              -dump_classes    =>   -debug-classes
              -dump_tags       =>   -debug-tags
              -dump_typedef    =>   -debug-typedef
              -dump_memory     =>   -debug-memory

            [Java C#] Fix director bug #1776651 reported by Stephane Routelous which occurred when
            the director class name is the same as the start of some other symbols used within
            the director class.

08/17/2007: wsfulton
            Correct behaviour for templated methods used with %rename or %ignore and the empty
            template declaration - %template(). A warning is issued if the method has not been
            renamed.

08/16/2007: mutandiz (Mikel Bancroft)
	    [allegrocl] Name generated cl file based on input file rather than by
	    module name. It was possible to end up with a mypackage.cl and a test_wrap.c
	    when parsing a test.i input file. Confusing. Also, include external-format
	    templates for :fat and :fat-le automatically to avoid these being compiled
	    at runtime.

08/15/2007: efuzzyone
            [cffi] Apply patch #1766076 from Leigh Smith adding support for newly introduced

08/09/2007: wsfulton
            [C#, Java] Add support for $owner in the "out" typemaps like in the scripting
            language modules. Note that $owner has always been supported in the "javaout" / "csout"
            typemaps.

08/01/2007: wsfulton
            Fix smart pointer handling for classes that have templated methods within the smart

07/24/2007: wsfulton
            Parallel make support added for the examples and test-suite for developers who have
            more than one CPU. Now parallel make can be used for checking in addition to building
            the SWIG executable. Some typical checking examples:

              make -j8 -k check
              make -j4 check-java-test-suite
              make -j2 check-java-examples

            [lua] Extra compatibility with Lua 5.1 (updated SWIG_init, docs, examples, test suite)
	    Removed name clash for static link of multiple modules

07/05/2007: mgossage
            [lua] Fix a bug in SWIG_ALLOC_ARRAY()
            improved the error messages for incorrect arguments.
            Changed the output of swig_type() to use the human readable form of the type,
	    rather than the raw swig type.

07/03/2007: wsfulton
            [C#] Fix directors for some overloaded methods where the imtype resulted in identical
            methods being generated in the C# director class, eg void foo(int *) and void foo(double *)
            used to generated two of these:

              private void SwigDirectorfoo(IntPtr p) { ... }

06/25/2007: wsfulton
            [Java, C#] Some parameter name changes in std_vector.i allowing better targeting

06/07/2007: mutandiz (Mikel Bancroft)
	    [allegrocl]
	    fix foreign-type constructor to properly look for ffitype typemap
	    bindings. fix inout_typemaps.i for strings.

06/06/2007: olly
	    [Ruby]
	    Use whichever of "long" or "long long" is the same size as "void*"
	    to hold pointers as integers, rather than whichever matches off_t.

05/29/2007: olly
	    [Python]
	    Split docstrings into separate string literals at each newline when
	    generating C/C++ wrapper code (the C/C++ compiler will just combine
	    them back into a single string literal).  This avoids MSVC
	    complaining that the strings are too long (problem reported by
	    Bo Peng on the mailing list).

05/28/2007: olly

	    Berthiaume for the patch).

05/25/2007: wsfulton
            Fixed %rename inconsistency in conversion operators as reported by Zhong Ren. The matching
            is now done on the operator name in the same way as it is done for parameters. For example:

              %rename(opABC) Space::ABC::operator ABC() const;
              %rename(methodABC) Space::ABC::method(ABC a) const;
              namespace Space {
                class ABC {
                  public:
                    void method(ABC a) const {}
                    operator ABC() const { ABC a; return a; }
                };
              }

            Note that qualifying the conversion operator previously may or may not have matched.
            Now it definitely won't, so this will not match:

              %rename(opABC) Space::ABC::operator Space::ABC() const;

            in the same way that this does not match:

              %rename(methodABC) Space::ABC::method(Space::ABC a) const;

            The documentation has been improved with respect to %rename, namespaces and templates.
            Conversion operators documentation too.

	    swig -python -threads now generates C/C++ code which uses Python's

	    tracker #1710341).

	    [Ruby]
	    Changed STL renames to be global renames.  This fixes

            Changed %rename("%(undercase)s") a little so that single

	    [Ruby]
	    Fixed Ruby documentation to use the proper css styles for
	    each section. Added autodoc section to Ruby's docs to
	    document the features supported by Ruby in documenting its modules.
	    Made rdoc documentation spit out the full name of the class +
	    method name.  Albeit this will make the current rdoc not recognize
            the method, this is still needed to disambiguate between different
            classes with similar methods (rdoc was created to document the
	    ruby source which only contains one class per c file, unlike swig)
            I have patched rdoc to make it more friendly to swig.  This
            patch needs to be merged in the ruby std library now.

05/03/2007: gga

	    Docstrings are now supported.
	    %feature("autodoc") and %feature("docstring") are now

05/02/2007: gga
	    [Ruby]
	    STL files have been upgraded to follow the new swig/python
	    Lib/std conventions.
	    This means std::vector, std::set, std::map, set::multimap,
	    std::multiset, std::deque and std::string are now properly
	    supported, including their iterators, support for containing
	    ruby objects (swig::GC_VALUE) and several other ruby
	    enhancements.
	    std::complex, std::ios, std::iostream, std::iostreambuf and
	    std::sstream are now also supported.
	    std::wstring, std::wios, std::wiostream, std::wiostreambuf
	    and std::wsstream are supported verbatim with no unicode
	    conversion.

	    std_vector.i now mimics the behavior of Ruby Arrays much more
	    closely, supporting slicing, shifting, unshifting,
            multiple indexing and proper return values on assignment.

	    COMPATABILITY NOTE: this changes the older api a little bit in
	    that improper indexing would previously (incorrectly) raise
	    exceptions.  Now, nil is returned instead, following ruby's
	    standard Array behavior.

05/02/2007: gga
	    [Ruby]
	    Changed the value of SWIG_TYPECHECK_BOOL to be 10000 (ie. higher
	    than that of all integers).
	    This is because Ruby allows typecasting
	    integers down to booleans which can make overloaded functions on
	    bools and integers to fail.
	    (bug# 1488142)

05/02/2007: gga
	    [Ruby]
	    Fixed a subtle bug in multiple argouts that could get triggered if
	    the user returned two or more arguments and the first one was an
	    array.

05/01/2007: gga
	    [Ruby]
	    Improved the documentation to document the new features
            added, add directorin/out/argout typemaps, etc.

05/01/2007: gga
	    [Ruby]
	    Added %initstack and %ignorestack directives for director
	    functions.  These allow you to control whether a director
	    function should re-init the Ruby stack.
	    This is sometimes needed for an embedded Ruby where the
	    director method is used as a C++ callback and not called
            by the user from ruby code.
	    Explanation:
	    Ruby's GC needs to be aware of the running OS stack in order to
	    mark any VALUE (Ruby objects) it finds there to avoid collection
	    of them.  This allows the ruby API to be very simple and allows
	    you to write code like "VALUE a = sth" anywhere without needing
	    to do things like refcounting like python.
	    By default, the start of the stack is set when ruby_init() is
	    called.   If ruby is inited within main(), as it usually is the
	    case with the main ruby executable, ruby will be able to calculate
	    its stack properly.  However, when this is not possible, as when
	    ruby is embedded as a plugin to an application where main is not
	    available, ruby_init() will be called in the wrong place, and
	    ruby will be incorrectly tracking the stack from the function
	    that called ruby_init() forwards only, which can lead to
	    all sorts of weird crashes or to ruby thinking it has run out of
	    stack space incorrectly.
	    To avoid this, director (callback) functions can now be tagged
	    to try to reset the ruby stack, which will solve the issues.
	    NOTE: ruby1.8.6 still contains a bug in it in that its function
	    to reset the stack will not always do so.  This bug is triggered
	    very rarely, when ruby is called from two very distinct places
	    in memory, like a branch of main() and another dso.  This bug
	    has now been reported to ruby-core and is pending further
	    investigation.

	    Ruby no longer creates the free_Class function if the class

	    (bug #1702882)

04/30/2007: gga
	    [Ruby]
	    Made directors raise a ruby exception for incorrect argout
	    returned values if RUBY_EMBEDDED is set, instead of throwing
	    an actual SwigDirector exception.
	    This will prevent crashes when ruby is embedded and unaware
	    of the SwigDirector exception.

	    [Ruby]
	    Removed the need for -DSWIGEXTERN.
	    Changed swig_ruby_trackings to be a static variable, but also

	    This allows properly dealing with trackings across multiple

	    (bug/patch #1545585)

04/29/2007: gga
	    [Ruby]
	    Upgraded Ruby converter to recognize "numinputs=0".  Previously,
	    only the old "ignore" flag was checked (which would currently
	    still work properly, but is deprecated).

04/29/2007: gga
	    [Ruby - but should be made generic]

	    %feature("numoutputs","0") added.

	    This feature allows you to ignore the output of a function so
	    that it is not added to a list of output values
	    ( ie. argouts ).
	    This should also become a feature of %typemap(directorout)
	    as "numoutputs"=0, just like "numinputs"=0 exists.

	    %feature("directors"=1)

	    %include <typemaps.i>

	    %feature("numoutputs","0") { Class::member_function1 };
	    %typemap(out) MStatus { // some code, like check mstatus

            New command line option -macroerrors.   When supplied, this will force
            the C scanner/parser to report proper location information for code contained
            inside SWIG macros (defined with %define).  By default, SWIG merely reports
            errors on the line at which a macro is used.  With this option, you
            can expand the error back to its source---something which may simplify
            debugging.

01/12/2007: beazley
            [Internals] Major overhaul of C/C++ scanning implementation.  For quite
            some time, SWIG contained two completely independent C/C++ tokenizers--
            the legacy scanner in CParse/cscanner.c and a general purpose scanner
            in Swig/scanner.c. SWIG still has two scanning modules, but the C parser
            scanner (CParse/cscanner.c) now relies upon the general purpose
            scanner found in Swig/scanner.c.  As a result, it is much smaller and
            less complicated.  This change also makes it possible to maintain all
            of the low-level C tokenizing in one central location instead of two
            places as before.

            ***POTENTIAL FLAKINESS***
            This change may cause problems with accurate line number reporting
            as well as error reporting more generally. I have tried to resolve this
            as much as possible, but there might be some corner cases.

10/29/2006: wsfulton
            [Java] Remove DeleteLocalRef from end of director methods for now as it is causing a
            seg fault when run on Solaris 8.

	    [Guile] Patch from Chris Shoemaker to clean up some warnings in the generated code.

10/29/2006: wsfulton
            [Java] Important fix to prevent early garbage collection of the Java proxy class
            while it is being used in a native method. The finalizer could destroy the underlying
            C++ object while it was being used. The problem occurs when the proxy class is no
            longer strongly reachable after a native call.  The problem seems to occur in
            memory stress situations on some JVMs. It does not seem to occur on the
            Sun client JVM up to jdk 1.5. However the 1.6 client jdk has a more aggressive garbage
            collector and so the problem does occur. It does occur on the Sun server
            JVMs (certainly 1.4 onwards). The fix entails passing the proxy class into the native
            method in addition to the C++ pointer in the long parameter, as Java classes are not
            collected when they are passed into JNI methods. The extra parameter can be suppressed
            by setting the nopgcpp attribute in the jtype typemap to "1" or using the new -nopgcpp
            commandline option.

            See Java.html#java_pgcpp for further details on this topic.

10/24/2006: wsfulton
            [C#] Fix smart pointer wrappers. The virtual/override/new keyword is not generated
            for each method as the smart pointer class does not mirror the underlying pointer
            class inheritance hierarchy. SF #1496535

10/24/2006: mgossage
            [lua] added support for native methods & member function pointers.
            fixed test cases arrays_dimensionless & cpp_basic. Added new example (functor).
            tidied up a little of the code (around classHandler).

10/17/2006: wsfulton
            [C#, Java] directorout typemap changes to fall in line with the other director
            languages. $result is now used where $1 used to be used. Please change your typemaps
            if you have a custom directorout typemap.

10/18/2006: wsfulton
            Some fixes for applying the char array typemaps to unsigned char arrays.

10/17/2006: wsfulton
            [C#, Java] Add in const size_t& and const std::size_t& typemaps.

10/15/2006: efuzzyone 
            [CFFI] Suppress generating defctype for enums, thanks to Arthur Smyles. Patch 1560983.

            [Chicken] Minor fix to make SWIG work with the (as yet unreleased) chicken 2.5

            [Guile,Chicken] Fix SF Bug 1573892.  Added an ext_test to the test suite to test
            this bug, but this test can not really be made generic because the external code must
            plug into the target language interpreter directly.
            See Examples/test-suite/chicken/ext_test.i and ext_test_external.cxx

            Added a %.externaltest to common.mk, and any interested language modules can
            copy and slightly modify either the chicken or the guile ext_test.i

10/14/2006: mgossage
            [Lua] added OUTPUT& for all number types, added a long long type
            fixed several test cases.
            update: changed typemaps to use SWIG_ConvertPtr rather than SWIG_MustGetPointer
            started spliting lua.swg into smaller parts to make it neater

10/13/2006: wsfulton
            [C#, Java] Marginally better support for multiple inheritance only in that you can
            control what the base class is. This is done using the new 'replace' attribute in the 
            javabase/csbase typemap, eg in the following, 'Me' will be the base class,
            no matter what Foo is really derived from in the C++ layer.

              %typemap(javabase, replace="1") Foo "Me";
              %typemap(csbase, replace="1") Foo "Me";

            Previously it was not possible for the javabase/csbase typemaps to override the C++ base.

10/12/2006: wsfulton
            [Java] Remove potential race condition on the proxy class' delete() method 
            (it is now a synchronized method, but is now customisable by changing the 
            methodmodifiers attribute in the javadestruct or javadestruct_derived typemap)

            [C#] Remove potential race condition on the proxy class' Dispose() method, 
            similar to Java's delete() above.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

10/12/2006: wsfulton
            [Ruby, Python] Remove redundant director code in %extend methods (%extend
            methods cannot be director methods)

10/12/2006: wsfulton
            [Ruby, Python] Fix #1505594 - director objects not returned as director objects
            in %extend methods.

10/11/2006: wsfulton
            [Java] Fix #1238798 - Directors using unsigned long long or any other type
            marshalled across the JNI boundary using a Java class (where the jni typemap 
            contains jobject).

            Director fixes for virtual conversion operators

10/04/2006: olly
	    [php] Fix #1569587 for PHP.  Don't use sizeof() except with string
	    literals.  Change some "//" comments to "/* */" for portability.

10/04/2006: mgossage
            [Lua] Partial Fix #1569587. The type is now correct, but the name is still not correct.

            [Ruby] Fix #1527885 - Overloaded director virtual methods sometimes produced
            uncompilable code when used with the director:except feature.

10/03/2006: wsfulton
            Directors: Directors are output in the order in which they are declared in 
            the C++ class rather than in some pseudo-random order.

            [CFFI] Bitfield support and vararg support due to Arthur Smyles.
            C expression to Lisp conversion, thanks to Arthur Smyles for the initial
            idea, it now supports conversion for a whole range of C expressions. 

09/28/2006: wsfulton
            Fix #1508327 - Overloaded methods are hidden when using -fvirtual optimisation.
            Overloaded methods are no longer candidates for elimination - this mimics
            C++ behaviour where all overloaded methods must be defined and implemented
            in a derived class in order for them to be available.

09/23/2006: olly
	    [Ruby] Support building with recent versions of the Ruby 1.9
	    development branch.  Fixes bug #1560092.

09/23/2006: olly
	    Templates can now be instantiated using negative numbers and
	    constant expressions, e.g.:

	    template<int q> class x {};
	    %template(x_minus1) x<-1>;
	    %template(x_1plus2) x<1+2>;

	    Also, constant expressions can now include comparisons (>, <, >=,
	    <=, !=, ==), modulus (%), and ternary conditionals (a ? b : c).

	    Fixes bugs #646275, #925555, #956282, #994301.

09/20/2006: olly
	    Treat a nested class definition as a forward declaration rather
	    than ignoring it completely, so that we generate correct code for
	    passing opaque pointers to the nested class (fixes SF bug #909387).

09/20/2006: olly
            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
	    [php] Overload resolution now works.  However to allow this, SWIG
	    generated wrappers no longer coerce PHP types (which reverts a change
	    made in 1.3.26).  So for example, if a method takes a string, you
	    can no longer pass a number without explicitly converting it to a
	    string in PHP using: (string)x

09/18/2006: mgossage
            [ALL] fix on swiginit.swg, has been reported to crash on several test cases
	    found and fixed problem in imports under python (mingw)

09/16/2006: wsfulton
            [Python] Patch from Michal Marek for Python 2.5 to fix 64 bit array indexes on
            64 bit machines.

09/13/2006: wsfulton
            The explicitcall feature has been scrapped. This feature was introduced primarily
            to solve recursive director method calls. Director upcall improvements made instead:

            [Python, Ruby, Ocaml] The swig_up flag is no longer used. The required mutexes
            wrapping this flag are also no longer needed. The recursive calls going from C++
            to the target language and back again etc are now avoided by a subtlely different
            approach. Instead of using the swig_up flag in each director method to indicate
            whether the explicit C++ call to the appropriate base class method or a normal
            polymorphic C++ call should be made, the new approach makes one of these calls
            directly from the wrapper method.

            [Java, C#] The recursive call problem when calling a C++ base class method from
            Java/C# is now fixed. The implementation is slightly different to the other languages
            as the detection as to whether the explicit call or a normal polymorphic call is made
            in the Java/C# layer rather than in the C++ layer.

09/11/2006: mgossage
            [ALL] updated swiginit.swg to allow multiple interpreters to use multiple
	    swig modules at once. This has been tested in Lua (mingw & linux),
	    perl5 & python (linux) only.

09/11/2006: mgossage
            [lua] added support for passing function pointers as well as native lua object
            into wrappered function.
            Added example funcptr3 to demonstrate this feature

09/05/2006: olly
	    [php] Rename ErrorCode and ErrorMsg #define-s to SWIG_ErrorCode
	    and SWIG_ErrorMsg to avoid clashes with code the user might be
	    wrapping (patch from Darren Warner in SF bug #1466086).  Any
	    user typemaps which use ErrorCode and/or ErrorMsg directly will
	    need adjusting - you can easily fix them to work with both old
	    and new SWIG by changing to use SWIG_ErrorMsg and adding:

		#ifndef SWIG_ErrorMsg
		#define SWIG_ErrorMsg() ErrorMsg()
		#endif

08/29/2006: olly
	    [php] Move constant initialisation from RINIT to MINIT to fix a
	    warning when using Apache and mod_php.  We only need to create
	    PHP constants once when we're first initialised, not for every HTTP
	    request.

08/21/2006: mgossage
            [Lua]
	    Bugfix #1542466 added code to allow mapping Lua nil's <-> C/C++ NULL's

	    added voidtest_runme.lua to show the features working

08/19/2006: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
	    [Guile] Add feature:constasvar to export constants as variables instead of functions
            that return the constant value.

08/11/2006: wsfulton
            [Java] DetachCurrentThread calls have been added so that natively created threads

	    - Add std_string.i support.
	    - Add newobject patch submitted by mkoeppe (thanks!)
	    - Fix type name mismatch issue for nested type definitions.
	      specifically typedefs in templated class defns.

07/18/2006: mgossage
	    Bugfix #1522858
	    updated lua.cxx to support -external-runtime command

07/14/2006: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
	    Increment the SWIG_RUNTIME_VERSION to 3, because of the
	    addition of the owndata member in swig_type_info.
	    Reported by: Prabhu Ramachandran

07/05/2006: wsfulton
            Search path fixes:
            - Fix search path for library files to behave as documented in Library.html.
            - Fix mingw/msys builds which did not find the SWIG library when installed.
            - Windows builds also output the mingw/msys install location when running
              swig -swiglib.
            - The non-existent and undocumented config directory in the search path has
              been removed.

07/04/2006: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
	    [Chicken]
	    Add %feature("constasvar"), which instead of exporting a constant as a

	    documentation as well.

07/04/2006: wsfulton
            [See entry of 09/13/2006 - explicitcall feature and documentation to it removed]
            New explicitcall feature which generates additional wrappers for virtual methods
            that call the method explicitly, not relying on polymorphism to make the method
            call. The feature is a feature flag and is enabled like any other feature flag.
            It also recognises an attribute, "suffix" for mangling the feature name, see
            SWIGPlus.html#SWIGPlus_explicitcall documentation for more details.

            [Java, C#]
            The explicitcall feature is also a workaround for solving the recursive calls
            problem when a director method makes a call to a base class method. See
            Java.html#java_directors_explicitcall for updated documentation.

06/28/2006: joe (Joseph Wang)

06/19/2005: olly
	    [php] Add support for generating PHP5 class wrappers for C++
	    classes (use "swig -php5").

06/17/2006: olly
	    [php] Added some missing keywords to the PHP4 keyword list, and
	    fixed __LINE__ and __FILE__ which were in the wrong category.
	    Also added all the keywords new in PHP5, and added comments
	    noting the PHP4 keywords which aren't keywords in PHP5.

05/19/2006: olly
	    [php] Removed support for -dlname (use -module instead).  Fixed
	    naming of PHP extension module to be consistent with PHP
	    conventions (no "php_" prefix on Unix; on PHP >= 4.3.0, handle Unix

	    [cffi]Thanks to Luke J Crook for this idea.
             - a struct/enum/union is replaced with :pointer only if
               that slot is actually a pointer to that type. So,: 
                    struct a_struct { int x; } and
                    struct b_struct { a_struct struct_1; }; 
               will be converted as:
                   (cffi:defcstruct b_struct
                           (struct_1 a_struct))

	    [cffi]
            Thanks to Thomas Weidner for the patch.
            - when feature export is set (export 'foo) is 
              generated for every symbol
            - when feature inline is set (declaim (inline foo)) is 
              generated before every function definition
            - when feature intern_function is set 
              #.(value-of-intern-function "name" "nodeType" package)
              is emitted instead of the plain symbol. A sample swig-lispify 
              is provided.
            - every symbol is prefixed by it's package.

04/13/2006: efuzzyone
	    [cffi]
	    Fixed the generation of wrappers for global variables. 
            Added the option [no]swig-lisp which turns on/off generation 
            of code for swig helper lisp macro, functions, etc.

Version 1.3.29 (March 21, 2006)
===============================

04/05/2006: mutandiz
	    [allegrocl]
	    Fix output typemap of char so it produces a character instead
	    of an integer. Also adds input/output typemaps for 'char *'.

	    add command-line argument -isolate to generate an interface
	    file that won't interfere with other SWIG generated files that
	    may be used in the same application.

03/20/2005: mutandiz
	    [allegrocl]
	    More tweaks to INPUT/OUTPUT typemaps for bool.

	    Fix constantWrapper for char and string literals.

	    find-definition keybindings should work in ELI/SLIME.
	    Output (in-package <module-name>) to lisp wrapper
	    instead of (in-package #.*swig-module-name*).

	    slight rework of multiple return values.

	    doc updates.

03/17/2005: mutandiz
	    [allegrocl]
	    mangle names of constants generated via constantWrapper.
	    
	    When using OUTPUT typemaps and the function has a non-void
	    return value, it should be first in the values-list, followed
	    by the OUTPUT mapped values.

	    Fix bug with boolean parameters, which needed to be
	    passed in as int values, rather than T or NIL.

	    Generate wrappers for constants when in C++ or -cwrap mode.
	    Make -cwrap the default, since it is most correct. Users
	    can use the -nocwrap option to avoid the creation of a .cxx
	    file when interfacing to C code.

	    When in -nocwrap mode, improve the handling of converting
 	    infix literals to prefix notation for lisp. This is very
	    basic and not likely to be improved upon since this only
	    applies to the -nocwrap case. Literals we can't figure out
	    will result in a warning and be included in the generated
	    code.

	    validIdentifier now more closely approximates what may be
	    a legal common lisp symbol.

	    - Add -O to the main program, which now enables -fastdispatch
	    
	    [Python]

	    - Add the -fastinit option to enable faster __init__
              methods. Setting 'this' as 'self.this.append(this)' in the python
	      code confuses PyLucene. Now the initialization is done in the
	      the C++ side, as reported by Andi and Robin.

	    - Add the -fastquery option to enable faster SWIG_TypeQuery via a
              python dict cache, as proposed by Andi Vajda

	    - Avoid to call PyObject_GetAttr inside SWIG_Python_GetSwigThis,

03/02/2006: wsfulton
            [Java]
            Removed extra (void *) cast when casting pointers to and from jlong as this
            was suppressing gcc's "dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules"
            warning. This warning could be ignored in versions of gcc prior to 4.0, but now the
            warning is useful as gcc -O2 and higher optimisation levels includes -fstrict-aliasing which
            generates code that doesn't work with these casts. The assignment is simply never made.
            Please use -fno-strict-aliasing to both suppress the warning and fix the bad assembly
            code generated. Note that the warning is only generated by the C compiler, but not
            the C++ compiler, yet the C++ compiler will also generate broken code. Alternatively use 
            -Wno-strict-aliasing to suppress the warning for gcc-3.x. The typemaps affected
            are the "in" and "out" typemaps in java.swg and arrays_java.swg. Users ought to fix
            their own typemaps to do the same. Note that removal of the void * cast simply prevents
            suppression of the warning for the C compiler and nothing else. Typical change:

            From:
              %typemap(in) SWIGTYPE * %{ $1 = *($&1_ltype)(void *)&$input; %}
            To:
              %typemap(in) SWIGTYPE * %{ $1 = *($&1_ltype)&$input; %}

            From:
              %typemap(out) SWIGTYPE * %{ *($&1_ltype)(void *)&$result = $1; %} 
            To:
              %typemap(out) SWIGTYPE * %{ *($&1_ltype)&$result = $1; %}

02/22/2006: mmatus 

	    When using directors, now swig will emit all the virtual
	    protected methods by default. 

	    In previous releases, you needed to use the 'dirprot'
	    option to achieve the same.

	    If you want, you can disable the new default behaviour,
	    use the 'nodirprot' option: 

	       swig -nodirprot ...

	    and/or the %nodirector feature for specific methods, i.e.:

	       %nodirector Foo::bar;

	       struct Foo {
	         virtual ~Foo();

	       protected:
	         virtual void bar();
	       };
	    

	    As before, pure abstract protected members are allways
	    emitted, independent of the 'dirprot/nodirprot' options.


02/22/2006: mmatus
	    Add the factory.i library for languages using the UTL (python,tcl,ruby,perl).
	    
            factory.i implements a more natural wrap for factory methods. 

	    For example, if you have:							    
	    								    
  	    ----  geometry.h --------					    
  	         struct Geometry {                          		    
  	           enum GeomType{			     			    
  	             POINT,				     		    
  	             CIRCLE				     		    
  	           };					     		    
  	           					     		    
  	           virtual ~Geometry() {}    		     		    
  	           virtual int draw() = 0;				    
  	    	 							    
  	    	 //							    
  	    	 // Factory method for all the Geometry objects		    
  	    	 //							    
  	           static Geometry *create(GeomType i);     		    
  	         };					     		    
  	         					     			    
  	         struct Point : Geometry  {		     		    
  	           int draw() { return 1; }		     		    
  	           double width() { return 1.0; }    	     		    
  	         };					     		    
  	         					     			    
  	         struct Circle : Geometry  {		     		    
  	           int draw() { return 2; }		     		    
  	           double radius() { return 1.5; }          		    
  	         }; 					     		    
  	         								    
  	         //							    
  	         // Factory method for all the Geometry objects		    
  	         //							    
  	         Geometry *Geometry::create(GeomType type) {		    
  	           switch (type) {			     		    
  	           case POINT: return new Point();	     		    
  	           case CIRCLE: return new Circle(); 	     		    
  	           default: return 0;			     		    
  	           }					     		    
  	         }					    		    
  	    ----  geometry.h --------					    
	    								    
	    								    
	    You can use the %factory with the Geometry::create method as follows:
	    								    
  	      %newobject Geometry::create;				    
  	      %factory(Geometry *Geometry::create, Point, Circle);	    
  	      %include "geometry.h"					    
	    								    
  	    and Geometry::create will return a 'Point' or 'Circle' instance   
  	    instead of the plain 'Geometry' type. For example, in python:	    
	    								    
  	      circle = Geometry.create(Geometry.CIRCLE)			    
  	      r = circle.radius()						    
	    								    
  	    where 'circle' now is a Circle proxy instance.

Version 1.3.28 (February 12, 2006)
==================================

02/11/2006: mmatus
	    Fix many issues with line counting and error reports.

02/11/2006: mmatus
	    [Python] Better static data member support, if you have
	    
                struct Foo {
                  static int bar;
                };

            then now is valid to access the static data member, ie:

                f = Foo()
                f.bar = 3

	    just as in C++.


02/11/2006: wsfulton
            [Perl]
            Fixed code generation to work again with old versions of Perl
            (5.004 and later tested)

02/04/2006: mmatus
	    [Python] Add the %extend_smart_pointer() directive to extend
	    SWIG smart pointer support in python. 

	    For example, if you have a smart pointer as:
	    
	      template <class Type> class RCPtr {
	      public:
	        ...
	        RCPtr(Type *p);
		Type * operator->() const;
		...
	      };
	      
	    you use the %extend_smart_pointer directive as:
	    
	      %extend_smart_pointer(RCPtr<A>);
	      %template(RCPtr_A)  RCPtr<A>;
	    
	    then, if you have something like:

	      RCPtr<A> make_ptr();
	      int foo(A *);

	    you can do the following:

	      a = make_ptr();
	      b = foo(a);

            ie, swig will accept a RCPtr<A> object where a 'A *' is
            expected.

	    Also, when using vectors
	    
	      %extend_smart_pointer(RCPtr<A>);
	      %template(RCPtr_A) RCPtr<A>;
	      %template(vector_A) std::vector<RCPtr<A> >;
		
	    you can type

	      a = A();
	      v = vector_A(2)
	      v[0] = a

            ie, an 'A *' object is accepted, via implicit conversion, 
	    where a RCPtr<A> object is expected. Additionally

	      x = v[0]

	    returns (and sets 'x' as) a copy of v[0], making reference
	    counting possible and consistent.

	    %extend_smart_pointer is just a collections of new/old
	    tricks, including %typemaps and the new %implicitconv
	    directive.

02/02/2006: mgossage
            bugfix #1356577, changed double=>lua_number in a few places.
            added the std::pair wrapping

01/30/2006: wsfulton
            std::string and std::wstring member variables and global variables now use
            %naturalvar by default, meaning they will now be wrapped as expected in all languages.
            Previously these were wrapped as a pointer rather than a target language string.
            It is no longer necessary to add the following workaround to wrap these as strings:

		%apply const std::string & { std::string *}

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY  ***

01/28/2006: mkoeppe
	    [Guile -scm] 
	    Add typemaps for handling of member function pointers.

01/24/2006: mmatus
	    - Better support for the %naturalvar directive, now it
	      works with the scripting languages as well as
	      Java/C#.
	      
	      Now, it can also be applied to class types:

	        %naturalvar std::string;
	        %include <std_string.i>
	      
              that will tell swig to use the 'natural' wrapping
              mechanism to all std::string global and member
              variables.

	    - Add support for the %allowexcept feature along the
              scripting languages, which allows the %exception feature
              to be applied to the variable access methods. Also, add
              the %exceptionvar directive to specify a distintic
              exception mechanism only for variables.
	      
	    
	    - Add more docs for the %delobject directive to mark a method as a
	      destructor, 'disowning' the first argument. For example:

	        %newobject create_foo;
	        %delobject destroy_foo;

	        Foo *create_foo() { return new Foo(); }
	        void destroy_foo(Foo *foo) { delete foo; }

	      or in a member method as:

	        %delobject Foo::destroy;

	        class Foo {
	        public:
	          void destroy() { delete this;}

	        private:
	          ~Foo();
               };


01/24/2006: mgossage
            [Lua]
	    - Removed the type swig_lua_command_info & replace with luaL_reg
	      (which then broke the code), fixed this
	    - added an additional cast in the typemaps for enum's
	      due to the issue that VC.Net will not allow casting of
	      a double to an enum directly. Therefore cast to int then to enum
	      (thanks to Jason Rego for this observation)

01/16/2006: mmatus (Change disabled... will be back in CVS soon)
	    Add initial support for regexp via the external library
	    RxSpencer. SWIG doesn't require this library to compile
	    and/or run. But if you specify --with-rxspencer, and the
	    library is found during installation, then swig will use
	    it in three places:

	    - In %renames rules, via the new rxsmatch rules, for example:
	    	  
	    	  %rename("%(lowercase)",rxsmatch$name="GSL_.*") "";
	    	  %rename("%(lowercase)",rxsmatch$nodeType="enum GSL_.*") "";
	    	 
              rxsmatch is similar to the match rule, it just uses
              the RxSpencer regexp library to decide if there is a
              match with the provided regexp. As with the match
              rule, you can also use the negate rule notrxsmatch.

	    - In the %rename target name via the rxstarget option, for example:
	    		 
	    	  %rename("%(lowercase)",rxstarget=1) "GSL_.*";

	    	where the target name "GSL.*" is now understood as a
	    	regexp to be matched.  
	    	 
            - In the new encoder "rxspencer", which looks like:

	    	  %(rxspencer:[regexp][replace])s

	    	where "regexp" is the regular expression and "replace"
	    	is a string used as a replacement, where the @0,@1,...,@9
	    	pseudo arguments are used to represent the
	    	corresponding matching items in the reg expression.

	    	For example:
	    		      
	        %(rxspencer:[GSL.*][@0])s       <- Hello    -> 
	        %(rxspencer:[GSL.*][@0])s       <- GSLHello -> GSLHello
	        %(rxspencer:[GSL(.*)][@1])s     <- GSLHello -> Hello
	        %(rxspencer:[GSL(.*)][gsl@1])s  <- GSLHello -> gslHello

	    	Another example could be:

                %rename("%(lowercase)s",sourcefmt="%(rxspencer:[GSL_(.*)][@1])s",%$isfunction) "";

	    	which take out the prefix "GSL_" and returns all the
	    	function names in lower cases, as following:

	    	    void GSL_Hello();   ->   hello();
	    	    void GSL_Hi();      ->   hi();
	    	    const int GSL_MAX;  ->   GSL_MAX;  // no change, is not a function
	
	    We use the RxSpencer as an initial test bed to
            implemention while we decide which library will be
            finally added to swig.

            You can obtain the RxSpencer library from 
	    
	      http://arglist.com/regex (Unix)

	    or
	     
	      http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html (Windows)

	    Once installed, use "man rxspencer" to get more info
	    about the regexp format, or just google rxspencer.

	    Since now you can enable the rxsmatch rules (see above),
            the simple or '|' support for the match rules
            (01/12/2006: mmatus) is disabled. Still, if you have
            problems with the rxspencer library, you can re-enable
            the simple 'match or' support using
            -DSWIG_USE_SIMPLE_MATCHOR.
	  

01/16/2006: mmatus
	    Change the %rename predicates to use the prefix '%$', as in:
	    
	      %rename("%(utitle)s",%$isfunction,%$ismember) ""; 
	   	
            to avoid clashes with other swig macros/directives.

01/14/2006: cfisavage
            [Ruby]
	    Added support for Ruby bang! methods via a new %bang feature.
	    Bang methods end in exclamation points and indicate that the
	    object being processed will be modified in-place as 
	    opposed to being copied.

01/12/2006: cfisavage
            [Ruby]
	    Updated the Ruby module to automatically convert
	    method names to lower_case_with_underscores using the
	    new %rename functionality.

01/12/2006: mmatus
	    - Add aliases for 'case' encoders used with %rename/%namewarn

	      %(uppercase)s   hello_world -> HELLO_WORLD
	      %(lowercase)s   HelloWorld  -> helloworld
	      %(camelcase)s   hello_world -> HelloWorld
	      %(undercase)s   HelloWorld  -> hello_world


01/12/2006: mmatus
	    - Add the -dump_parse_module and -dump_parse_top options,
	    which are similar to -dump_module and -dump_top, but they
	    dump the node trees just after parsing, showing only the 
	    attributes visible at the parsing stage, and not the added
	    later in typemap.cxx, allocate.cxx, lang.cxx or elsewhere.
	    
	    Besides debugging porpuses, these options are very useful
	    if you plan to use %rename in an "advance way", since it
	    shows only and all the node's attributes you can use
	    inside the match rules.


01/12/2006: mmatus
	    - Add predicates to %rename, so, you don't need to
	      remember, for example, how to match a member function.

	      Now it is easy, for example to use the 'utitle' encoder 
	      in all the member methods, you type:

	        %rename("%(utitle)s",%isfunction,%ismember) "";

	      or to ignore all the enumitems in a given class:

	        %rename("$ignore", %isenumitem, %classname="MyClass") "";  

	      Available predicates are (see swig.swg):

                %isenum         
		%isenumitem     
		%isaccess       
		%isclass        
		%isextend       
		%isextend       
		%isconstructor  
		%isdestructor   
		%isnamespace    
		%istemplate     
		%isconstant     
					
		%isunion        
		%isfunction     
		%isvariable     
		%isimmutable    
					
		%isstatic       
		%isfriend       
		%istypedef      
		%isvirtual      
		%isexplicit     
		%isextern       
					
		%ismember       
		%isglobal 
		%innamespace

		%ispublic    
		%isprotected 
		%isprivate   
				     
		%classname   

              These predicates correspond to specific 'match'
              declarations, which sometimes are not as evident as the
              predicates names.


            - Add the or '|' operation in %rename match, for
              example to capitalize all the constants (%constant or
              const cdecl):

                 %rename("%(upper)s",match="cdecl|constant",%isimmutable) "";
                


01/12/2006: mgossage
	    -	Partial fixed of errors under C89, bug #1356574
	    	(converted C++ style comments to C style)
	    -	Added patches from neomantra@users.sf.net #1379988 and #1388343
	    	missing a 'return' statement for error conditions
	    	also updated the %init block bug #1356586
		 
01/10/2006: mmatus
	    - Add the 'utitle' encoder, as an example of how to add
	      your own encoder. I added the encoder method in misc.c 
	      but developers can add others, the same way, inside any
	      target language.
	      
	      Well, 'utitle' is the reverse of 'ctitle', ie:

	         %rename("%(ctitle)s") camel_case;  -> CamelCase;
	         %rename("%(utitle)s") CamelCase;   -> camel_case;
		 

01/10/2006: cfisavage
            [Ruby]
            Updated Ruby Exception handling.  Classes that are specified in throws clauses, 
            or are marked as %exceptionclass, are now inherited from rb_eRuntimeError. 
            This allows instances of these classes to be returned to Ruby as exceptions. 
            Thus if a C++ method throws an instance of MyException, the calling Ruby 
            method will get back a MyException object.  To see an example, 
            look at ruby/examples/exception_class.

01/10/2006: mmatus
	    
            - Add the %catches directive, which complements the %exception
	    directive in a more automatic way. For example, if you have

                int foo() throw(E1);

            swig generates the proper try/catch code to dispatch E1.
	    
	    But if you have:


	          int barfoo(int i) {
                    if (i == 1) {
	               throw E1();
                    } else {
	              throw E2();
                    }
                    return 0;
                  }

            ie, where there is no explicit exception specification in the decl, you 
	    end up doing:
		  
               %exception barfoo {			
	         try {				
	           $action			
	         } catch(E1) {	... }				  
	         } catch(E2) {	... }				  
	       }				
	    
	    which is very tedious. Well, the %catches directive defines
	    the list of exceptions to catch, and from swig:
 	
	       %catches(E1,E2) barfoo(int i);
	       int barfoo(int i);

            is equivalent to 

	       int barfoo(int i) throw(E1,E2);

	    Note, however, that the %catches list doesn't have to
	    correspond to the C++ exception specification. For example, if you
	    have:

		struct E {};
		struct E1 : E {};
		struct E2 : E {};

  	        int barfoo(int i) throw(E1,E2);

            you can define
	        
		%catches(E) barfoo(int i);
	
	    and swig will generate an action code equivalent to

	         try {				
	           $action			
	         } catch(E &_e) { 
		   <raise _e>;
		 }	

            Of course, you still have to satisfy the C++ restrictions,
	    and the catches list must be compatible (not the same)
	    as the original list of types in the exception specification.

	    Also, you can now specify that you want to catch the
	    unknown exception '...', for example:

	       %catches(E1,E2,...) barfoo(int);

	    In any case, the %catches directive will emit the
	    code to convert into the target language error/exception
            using the 'throws' typemap.

	    For the '...' case to work, you need to
	    write the proper typemap in your target language. In the
	    UTL, this looks like:

	      %typemap(throws) (...) {
	        SWIG_exception(SWIG_RuntimeError,"unknown exception");
              }

	    [Allegrocl]

            Fixes a number of SEGVs primarily in the handling of
            various anonymous types. Found in a pass through the
            swig test-suite. Still more to do here, but this is a
            good checkpoint.

            Adds -cwrap and -nocwrap as an allegrocl specific
            command-line argument. Controls generating of a C
            wrapper file when wrapping C code. By default only a
            lisp file is created for C code wrapping.

            Doc updates for the command-line arguments and fixes as
            pointed out on swig-devel

            [Java] Fix unsigned long long and const unsigned long long & typemaps
            - Bug #1398394  with patch from Dries Decock

01/06/2006: mmatus
	    Add 'named' warning codes, now in addition to:
	    
	      %warnfilter(813);
	   
	    you can use

	      %warnfilter(SWIGWARN_JAVA_MULTIPLE_INHERITANCE);

	    just use the same code name found in  Source/Include/swigwarn.h 
	    plus the 'SWIG' prefix.

	    If a developer adds a new warning code, the Lib/swigwarn.swg file
            will be generated when running the top level make.

01/05/2006: cfisavage
            [Ruby]
	    Reimplemented object tracking for Ruby.  The new implementation works
	    by expanding the swig_class structure for Ruby by adding a trackObjects
	    field.  This field can be set/unset via %trackobjects as explained
	    in the Ruby documentation.  The new implementation is more robust
	    and takes less code to implement.
		
01/05/2006: wsfulton
            Fix for %extend and static const integral types, eg:

              class Foo {
                public:
                %extend {
                    static const int bar = 42;
                }
              }; 

12/30/2005: mmatus

	  - Add info for old and new debug options:
              
            -dump_top       - Print information of the entire node tree, including system nodes    
     	    -dump_module    - Print information of the module node tree, avoiding system nodes     
     	    -dump_classes   - Print information about the classes found in the interface	       
     	    -dump_typedef   - Print information about the types and typedefs found in the interface
     	    -dump_tags      - Print information about the tags found in the interface	       
     	    -debug_typemap  - Print information for debugging typemaps			       
            -debug_template - Print information for debugging templates			        

	  - Add the fakeversion. If you have a project that uses
            configure/setup.py, or another automatic building system
            and requires a specific swig version, let say 1.3.22 
	    you can use:

	       SWIG_FEATURES="-fakeversion 1.3.22"

	     or
 
               swig -fakeversion 1.3.22

             and then swig -version will report 1.3.22 instead of the
             current version.

	     Typical use would be

	       SWIG_FEATURES="-fakeversion 1.3.22" ./configure 	     

12/30/2005: mmatus

	  - Add option/format support to %rename and %namewarn.	
	    Now %namewarn can force renaming, for example:

	      %namewarn("314: import is a keyword",rename="_%s") "import";
	    
	    and rename can also support format forms:

	       %rename("swig_%s") import;

	    Now, since the format is processed via swig Printf, you
	    can use encoders as follows:

	       %rename("%(title)s")  import;     -> Import
	       %rename("%(upper)s")  import;     -> IMPORT
	       %rename("%(lower)s")  Import;     -> import
	       %rename("%(ctitle)s") camel_case; -> CamelCase
	       
	    This will allow us to add more encoders, as the 
	    expected one for regular expressions. 

	  - Add the above 'ctitle' encoder, which does the camel case:

	        camel_case -> CamelCase
  
	  - Also, while we get the regexp support, add the 'command' encoder,
            you can use it as follows

               %rename("%(command:sed -e 's/\([a-z]\)/\U\\1/' <<< )s") import; 

	    then swig will popen the command
	    
		"sed -e 's/\([a-z]\)/\U\\1/' <<< import"
		
            see below for anonymous renames for better examples.		

          - The rename directive now also allows:

	    - simple match: only apply the rename if a type match
	      happen, for example

		 %rename(%(title)s,match="enumitem") hello;

		 enum Hello {
		   hi, hello  ->  hi, Hello  
		 };
		 int hello()  ->  hello; 

	    - extended match: only apply the rename if the 'extended attribute' match
	      occurred, for example: 

	         // same as simple match 		
		 %rename(%(title)s,match$nodeType="enumitem") hello; 

		 enum Hello {
		   hi, hello  ->  hi, Hello  
		 };

	       Note that the symbol '$' is used to define the attribute name in
	       a 'recursive' way, for example:

		 // match only hello in 'enum Hello'
		 %rename(%(title)s,match$parentNode$type="enum Hello") hello; 

		 enum Hello {
 		   hi, hello  ->  hi, Hello   // match
		 };

		 enum Hi {
 		   hi, hello  ->  hi, hello   // no match
		 };

               here, for Hello::hi, the "parentNode" is "Hello", and its "type"
               is "enum Hello".
	       
	       
            - Anonymous renames: you can use 'anonymous' rename directives, for example: 

	         // rename all the enum items in Hello
		 %rename(%(title)s,match$parentNode$type="enum Hello") ""; 

		 enum Hello {
 		   hi, hello  ->  Hi, Hello   // match both
		 };

		 enum Hi {
 		   hi, hello  ->  hi, hello   // no match
		 };
		 
	         // rename all the enum items 
		 %rename(%(title)s,match$nodeType="enumitem") ""; 

	         // rename all the items in given command (sloooow, but...)
		 %rename(%(command:<my external cmd>)s) ""; 

	
	      Anonymous renames with commands can be very powerful, since you
	      can 'outsource' all the renaming mechanism (or part of it) to an
	      external program:
	      
	        // Uppercase all (and only) the names that start with 'i'
	        %rename("%(command:awk '/^i/{print toupper($1)}' <<<)s") "";   
	       
	        int imported() -> IMPORTED;
	        int hello()    -> hello

	      Note that if the 'command' encoder returns an empty string, swig
	      understands that no rename is necessary.

	      Also note that %rename 'passes' the matched name. For example, in
	      this case

	        namespace ns1 {
		  int foo();
		}

	        namespace ns2 {
		  int bar();
		}

	      the external program only receives "foo" and "bar". If needed,
	      however, you can request the 'fullname' 
	       	
	        %rename("%(command:awk 'awk '/ns1::/{l=split($1,a,"::"); print toupper(a[l])}'' <<<)s",fullname=1) "";   
                
		ns1::foo -> FOO
		ns2::bar -> bar	
	
	    - Mixing encoders and matching: of course, you can do mix commands
	      and match fields, for example:

	        %rename("%(<my encoder for fncs>)",match="cdecl") "";
	        %rename("%(<my encoder for enums>)",match="enumitem") "";
	        %rename("%(<my encoder for enums inside a class>)",match="enumitem",
		        match$parentNode$parentNode$nodeType="class") "";
		
	      Use "swig -dump_parse_module" to see the attribute names you can use to
	      match a specific case.
	
            - 'sourcefmt' and 'targetfmt': sometimes you need to
              process the 'source' name before comparing, for example

	        %namewarn("314: empty is a keyword",sourcefmt="%(lower)s") "empty";

	      then if you have

	        int Empty();  // "Empty" is the source 
		
	      you will get the keyword warning since 'Empty' will be
	      lower cased, via the sourcefmt="%(lower)s" option,
	      before been compared to the 'target' "empty".

	      There is an additional 'targetfmt' option to process the
	      'target' before comparing.

	    - complementing 'match': you can use 'notmatch', for example
	      
	        %namewarn("314: empty is a keyword",sourcefmt="%(lower)s",notmatch="namespace") "empty";

	      here, the name warning will be applied to all the symbols except namespaces.

	  - Add initial support for gcj and Java -> <target language> mechanism.

	    See	examples in:  
	  
		Examples/python/java
		Examples/ruby/java
		Examples/tcl/java

            to see how to use gcj+swig to export java classes into
            python/ruby/tcl.
	    
	    The idea is to put all the common code for gcj inside

	          Lib/gcj

            and localize specific types such as jstring, as can be found
            in

	         Lib/python/jstring.i
	         Lib/ruby/jstring.i
	         Lib/tcl/jstring.i

            Using the UTL, this is very easy, and the perl version for
            jstring.i will be next.
		 	    

12/29/2005: mmatus
	  - Add the copyctor feature/directive/option to enable the automatic
	    generation of copy constructors. Use as in:

	      %copyctor A;

	      struct A {

              };

	    then this will work

	      a1 = A();
	      a2 = A(a1);

	    Also, since it is a feature, if you just type

	      %copyctor;

	    that will  enable the automatic generation for all the
	    classes. It is also equivalent to

	       swig -copyctor -c++ ...

	    Notes: 

	    1.- The feature only works in C++ mode.

	    2.- The automatic creation of the copy constructor will
	        usually produce overloading. Hence, if the target
	        language doesn't support overloading, a special name
	        will be used (A_copy).
	    
	    3.- For the overloading reasons above, it is probably not
                a good idea to use the flag when, for example, you are
		using keywords in Python.

            4.- The copyctor automatic mechanism follows more or less
	        the same rules as the default constructor mechanism,
	        i.e., a copy constructor will not be added if the
	        class is abstract or if there is a pertinent non-public 
		copy ctor in the class or its hierarchy.

		Hence, it might be necessary for you to complete the
		class declaration with the proper non-public copy ctor
		to avoid a wrong constructor addition.
		
          - Fix features/rename for templates ctor/dtor and other
            things around while adding the copyctor mechanism.
	    

12/27/2005: mmatus
	  - Add the 'match' option to typemaps. Assume you have:

	      %typemap(in) SWIGTYPE * (int res) {..}
	      %typemap(freearg) SWIGTYPE * { if (res$argnum) ...}

	    then if you do
 
	      %typemap(in) A * {...}

	    swig will 'overload the 'in' typemap, but the 'freearg' 
	    typemap will be also applied, even when this is wrong. The old
	    solutions is to write:

	      %typemap(in) A * {...}
  	      %typemap(freeag) A * "";

	    overload 'freearg' with an empty definition.

	    The problem is, however, there is no way to know you need
	    to do that until you start getting broken C++ code, or
	    worse, broken runtime code.

	    The same applies to the infamous 'typecheck' typemap,
	    which always confuses people, since the first thing you do
	    is to just write the 'in' typemap.

	    The 'match' option solves the problem, and if instead you write:

	      %typemap(in) SWIGTYPE * (int res) {..}
	      %typemap(freearg,match="in") SWIGTYPE * { if (res$argnum) ...}
	      %typemap(typecheck,match="in",precedence...) SWIGTYPE * {...}
	    
	    it will tell swig to apply the 'freearg/typecheck'
	    typemaps only if they 'match' the type of the 'in'
	    typemap. The same can be done with other typemaps as:

	      %typemap(directorout) SWIGTYPE * {...}
	      %typemap(directorfree,match="directorout") SWIGTYPE * {...}
	    

12/27/2005: mmatus
	  - Add the 'naturalvar' option/mode/feature to treat member
	    variables in a more natural way, ie, similar to the global
	    variable behavior.

	    You can use it in a global way via the command line

	      swig -naturalvar ...

	    or the module mode option
 
	      %module(naturalvar=1)

	    both forms make swig treat all the member variables in the
	    same way it treats global variables. 

	    Also, you can use it in a case by case approach for
	    specific member variables using the directive form:

	      %naturalvar Bar::s;
	    
	    Then, in the following case for example:

	       std::string s;
	       struct Bar {
		 std::string s;
               };

            you can do:  

	       b = Bar()
	       b.s ="hello"
	       cvar.s = "hello"
	       
	       if (b.s != cvar.s):
	          raise RuntimeError

		  
            This is valid for all the languages, and the
            implementation is based on forcing the use of the 
            const SWIGTYPE& (C++)/SWIGTYPE (C) typemaps for the
            get/set methods instead of the SWIGTYPE * typemaps.
	    Hence, for 'naturalvar' to work, each target language
	    must implement 'typemap(in/out) const Type&' properly.

	    The 'naturalvar' option replaces or makes workarounds such  as:
	    
		%apply const std::string & { std::string *}

            unnecessary.

	    Note1: If your interface has other kinds of workarounds to
	    deal with the old 'unnatural' way to deal with member
	    variables (returning/expecting pointers), the
	    'naturalvar' option could break them.
	    
	    Note2: the option has no effect on unnamed types, such
	    as unnamed nested unions.
	    
	  
12/27/2005: mmatus
	  - Add more 'expressive' result states for the typemap
            libraries.

	    In the past, for scripting languages, you would do checking something like:

	      if (ConvertPtr(obj,&vptr,ty,flags) != -1) {
	        // success
              } else {
	        // error
	      }

	    Now the result state can carry more information,
	    including:

	      - Error state: like the old -1/0, but with error codes from swigerrors.swg.

	         int res = ConvertPtr(obj,&vptr,ty,flags);
		 if (SWIG_IsOK(res)) {
		   // success code
                 } else {
		   SWIG_Error(res); // res carries the error code
                 }

	      - Cast rank: when returning a simple successful
                conversion, you just return SWIG_OK, but if you need
                to do a 'cast', you can add the casting rank, ie:
		
		  if (PyFloat_Check(obj)) {
		    value = PyFloat_AsDouble(obj);
		    return SWIG_OK;
		  } else if (PyInt_Check(obj)) {
		    value = (double) PyInt_AsLong(obj);
		    return SWIG_AddCast(SWIG_OK);		    
                  }
		
		later, the casting rank is used to properly dispatch
		the overloaded function, for example. This of course
		requires your language to support and use the new
		dispatch cast/rank mechanism (Now mainly supported in
		perl and python, and easily expandable to ruby and tcl).
	      
	  - [UTL] Add support for the new 'expressive' result states.

12/27/2005: mmatus
	  - Add support for the C++ implicit conversion mechanism, which
            required some modifications in parser.y (to recognize
            'explicit') and overload.cxx (to replace $implicitconv as
            needed).
	    
	    Still, real support in each target language requires each
	    target language to be modified. Python provides an example,
            see below.


	  - Add support for native C++ implicit conversions, ie, if you
            have

	        %implicitconv A;

	        struct A {
		   int ii;
		   A() {ii = 1;}
		   A(int) {ii = 2;}
		   A(double) {ii = 3;}
		   explicit A(char *s) {ii = 4;}
		};
		
		int get(const A& a) {return a.ii;}

            you can call:

	        a = A()
	        ai = A(1)
	        ad = A(1.0)
	        as = A("hello")
		
		# old forms
	        get(a)  -> 1
	        get(ai) -> 2
	        get(ad) -> 3
	        get(as) -> 4
		
		#implicit conversions
	        get(1)       -> 2
	        get(1.0)     -> 3
	        get("hello") -> Error, explicit constructor

            Also, as in C++, now implicit conversions are supported in
            variable assigments, and if you have:

	      A ga;
	      struct Bar {
	        A a;
              };

	    you can do:

	      cvar.ga = A(1)
	      cvar.ga = 1
	      cvar.ga = 1.0
	      cvar.ga = A("hello") 
	      cvar.ga = "hello" -> error, explicit constructor

	      b = Bar()
	      b.a = A("hello")
	      b.a = 1
	      b.a = 1.0
	      b.a = "hello" -> error, explicit constructor

	    Note that the last case, assigning a member var directly, 
	    also requires the 'naturalvar' option.

	    This support now makes the old '%implicit' macro, which
	    was found in 'implicit.i' and it was fragile in many ways,
	    obsolete, and you should use the new '%implicitconv'
	    directive instead.

	    Note that we follow the C++ conventions, ie, in the
	    following the implicit conversion is allowed:

		int get(A a) {return a.ii;}
		int get(const A& a) {return a.ii;}
	    
	    but not in these cases:

		int get(A *a) {return a->ii;}
		int get(A& a) {return a.ii;}
		
	    Also, it works for director methods that return a by value
	    result, ie, the following will work:

                virtual A get_a() = 0;

		def get_a(self):
		   return 1

            but not in this case:

                virtual const A& get_a() = 0;
                virtual A& get_a() = 0;
                virtual A* get_a() = 0;
	    
	  Notes:

	  - the implicitconv mechanism is implemented by directly
	    calling/dispatching the python constructor, triggering a
	    call to the __init__method. Hence, if you expanded the
	    __init__ method, like in:

	        class A:
		   def __init__(self,args):
		      <swig code>
		      <my code here>

            then 'my code' will also be executed.
	    
	  - Since the %implicitconv directive is a SWIG feature, if you type:
	    
  	       %implicitconv;  

	    that will enable implicit conversion for all the classes in
	    your module.

	    But if you are worried about performance, maybe that will be
	    too much, especially if you have overloaded methods, since
	    to resolve the dispatching problem, python will efectively
	    try to call all the implicit constructors as needed.

	  - For the same reason, it is highly recommended that you use
            the new 'castmode' when mixing implicit conversion and
            overloading.

	 - [python] The %implicit directive is declared obsolete, and
           you should use %implicitconv instead. If you include
	   the implicit.i file, a warning will remind you of this.

	   Note: Since %implicit is fragile, just replacing it by
	   %implicitconv could lead to different behavior. Hence, we
	   don't automatically switch from to the other, and the user
	   must migrate to the new %implicitconv directive manually.

            [C#]
            Modify std::vector wrappers to use std::vector::value_type as this is
            closer to the real STL declarations for some methods, eg for push_back().
            Fixes some compilation errors for some compilers eg when the templated
            type is a pointer.

            [Java]
            std::vector improvements - a few more methods are wrapped and specializations are
            no longer required. The specialize_std_vector macro is no longer needed (a
            warning is issued if an attempt is made to use it).

12/26/2005: wsfulton
            [Java, C#]
            Add in pointer reference typemaps. This also enables one to easily wrap

            [CFFI] The cffi module for SWIG:
              - Fully supports C, but provides limited supports for C++, in
               particular C++ support for templates and overloading needs to
               be worked upon. 

12/23/2005: mmatus
	    [python] Add the castmode that allows the python
	    type casting to occur.

	    For example, if you have 'int foo(int)', now
	    
	      class Ai():
	         def __init__(self,x): 
		    self.x = x
	         def __int__(self): 
		    return self.x

	      foo(1)   // Ok
	      foo(1.0) // Ok
	      foo(1.3) // Error
	      a = Ai(4)
              foo(ai)  // Ok

            The castmode, which can be enabled either with the
            '-castmode' option or the %module("castmode") option, uses
            the new cast/rank dispatch mechanism. Hence, now if you
            have 'int foo(int); int foo(double);', the following works
            as expected:

	      foo(1)   -> foo(int)
	      foo(1.0) -> foo(double)
	      ai = Ai(4)
	      foo(ai)  -> foo(int)

	    Note1: the 'castmode' could disrupt some specialized
	    typemaps. In particular, the "implicit.i" library seems to
	    have problem with the castmode. But besides that one, the
	    entire test-suite compiles fine with and without the
	    castmode.

 	    Note2: the cast mode can't be combined with the fast
	    dispatch mode, ie, the -fastdispatch option has no effect
	    when the cast mode is selected. The penalties, however,
	    are minimum since the cast dispatch code is already based
	    on the same fast dispatch mechanism.

	    See the file overload_dispatch_cast_runme.py file for
	    new cases and examples.

12/22/2005: mmatus
	    Add the cast and rank mechanism to dispatch overloading
	    functions. The UTF supports it now, but for each language
	    it must be decided how to implement and/or when to use it.

	    [perl] Now perl uses the new cast and rank dispatch
	    mechanism, which solves all the past problems known 
	    in perl, such as the old '+ 1' problem:

	        int foo(int);
	    
		$n = 1
                $n = $n + 1
                $r = foo(n)

            also works:

                 foo(1);
                 foo("1");
                 foo(1.0);
                 foo("1.0");

             but fails

                 foo("l");

             and when overloading  foo(int) and foo(double);

                 foo(1) -> foo(int)
                 foo(1.0) -> foo(double)
                 foo("1") -> foo(int)
                 foo("1.0") -> foo(double)
                 foo("l") -> error
		 foo($n) -> foo(int)  for good perl versions
		 foo($n) -> foo(double)  for old bad perl versions

	     when overloading foo(int), foo(char*) and foo(double):

                 foo(1) -> foo(int)
                 foo(1.0) -> foo(double)
                 foo("1") -> foo(char*)
                 foo("1.0") -> foo(char*)
                 foo("l") -> foo(char*)

             Note: In perl the old dispatch mechanism was broken,
             so, we don't provide an option to enable the old one
	     since, again, it was really really broken.

	     See 'overload_simple_runme.pl' for more cases and tests.

	     PS: all the old known issues are declared resolved, any
	     new "problem" that could be discovered is declared, 
	     a priori, as "features" of the new dispatch mechanism
	     (until we find another solution at least).
	     
	     
            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY  ***

	    As with the introduction of the UTF, some things could
	    now start to work as expected, and people used to deal or
	    workaround previous bugs related to the dispatch
	    mechanism, could see now a difference in perl behavior.

12/21/2005: mmatus
	  - The '-nodefault' flag (pragma and feature) now generates
	    a warning, and recommends to use the explicit
	    -nodefaultctor and  -nodefaultdtor options.
	    
	    The reason to split the 'nodefault' behavior is that, in
	    general, ignoring the default destructor generates memory
	    leaks in the target language. Hence, is too risky just to
	    disable both the default constructor and destructor
	    at the same time.

	    If you need to disable the default destructor, it is
	    also recommended you use the directive form:

	       %nodefaultdtor  MyVerySpecialClass;

            for specific classes, and always avoid using the global
            -nodefault and -nodefaultdtor options.

              %module(imclassname="myimclassnewname") "mymodule" // C#

            Add in new special variable $imclassname. See docs.

	  [Python]
	  - Add the -aliasobj0/-noaliasobj0 options to use with
	    -fastunpack and/or -O and old typemaps that use 'obj0'
	    directly.

	    So, if you compile your code using -O and get errors about
	    the undeclared 'obj0' variable, run again using 

		swig -O -aliasobj0 -python ....
	    
	    For new typemaps, never use 'obj0' directly, if needed,
	    use the '$self' name that will be properly  expanded to
	    'obj0' (nofastunpack) or 'swig_obj[0]' (fastunpack). 
  
	    If you have no idea what I am talking about, better, that
	    means you have no typemap with this problem.


12/14/2005: mmatus 	 
	  [Python]
	  - Add the -fastunpack/-nofastunpack options to enable/disable
	    the use of the internal UnpackTuple method, instead of
	    calling the one from the python C API.

	    The option -O now also implies -fastunpack.
	    

12/11/2005: mmatus 
	  [Python]
	  - Add the -proxydel/-noproxydel options to enable/disable
	    the generation of proxy/shadow __del__ methods, even
	    when now they are redundant, since they are empty.
	    However, old interfaces could rely on calling them.

	    The default behavior is to generate the __del__ methods
	    as in 1.3.27 or older swig versions.

	    The option -O now also implies -noproxydel.

	  [Python] 
	  - Add the -dirvtable/-nodirvtable to enable/disable
	    a pseudo virtual table used for directors, avoiding
	    the need to resolve the python method at each call.
	    
	  - Add the -safecstrings/-nosafecstrings options to
	    enable/disable the use of safe conversions from PyString
	    to char *. Python requires you to never change the internal
	    buffer directly, and hence 'safectrings' warranties that
	    but returning a copy of the internal python string buffer.

	    The default, as in previous releases, is to return a
	    pointer to the buffer (nosafecstrings), so, it is the user's
	    responsibility to avoid its modification.
	    
	  - Add the -O option to enable all the optimization options
	    at once, initially equivalent to

	    -modern -fastdispatch -dirvtable -nosafecstrings -fvirtual

12/08/2005: mmatus 

	  - Add the -fastdispatch option (fastdispatch feature). This
	    enables the "fast dispatch" mechanism for overloaded
	    methods provided by Salvador Fandi~no Garc'ia (#930586).

	    The resulting code is smaller and faster since less type
	    checking is performed. However, the error messages you
	    get when the overloading is not resolved could be
	    different from what the traditional method returns.

	    With the old method you always get an error such as 

	       "No matching function for overloaded ..."

            with the new method you can also get errors such as

	       "Type error in argument 1 of type ..."

	    See bug report #930586 for more details.
            
  	    So, this optimization must be explicitly enabled by users.

	    The new mechanism can be used as:

              swig -fastdispatch

            or using the feature form

	      %feature("fastdispatch") method;
            or
              %fastdispatch method;
	    

12/06/2005: mmatus 

          - Several memory and speed improvements, specially for
	    templates. Now swig is up to 20 faster than before for
	    large template interfaces, such as the std_containers.i
	    and template_matrix.i files in the python test-suite.

	    Memory footprint is also reduced in consideration of small
	    pcs/architectures.

	  - add commandline options -cpperraswarn and -nocpperraswarn" to force
            the swig preprocessor to treat the #error directive as a #warning.
	    
	    the pragmas

               #pragma SWIG cpperraswarn=1
               #pragma SWIG cpperraswarn=0
	       
	    are equivalent to the command line options, respectively.

	    [Python] The generated code is now more portable, especially
	    for Windows. Following 

                 http://www.python.org/doc/faq/windows.html

            Py_None is never accessed as a structure, plus other
            tricks mentioned there.

12/06/2005: mmatus
	    [Python] Added initial support for threads based in the
	    proposal by Joseph Winston.

	    The user interface is as follows:

	    1.- the module thread support is enable via the "threads" module
                option, i.e.

                  %module("threads"=1)

            2.- Equivalent to that, is the new '-threads' swig option

                  swig -threads -python ...

            3.- You can partially disable thread support for a given
                method using:

                  %feature("nothread") method;
                or
		  %nothread method;

                also, you can disable sections of the thread support, 
                for example

                  %feature("nothreadblock") method;
                or
		  %nothreadblock method;

                  %feature("nothreadallow") method;
                or
		  %nothreadallow method;

                the first disables the C++/python thread protection, and the
                second disables the python/C++ thread protection. 

            4.- The current thread support is based in the PyGIL
                extension present in python version 2.3 or later, but
                you can provide the thread code for older versions by
                defining the macros in pythreads.swg.

		If you get a working implementation for older versions,
		please send us a patch.

            For the curious about performance, here are some numbers
            for the profiletest.i test, which is used to check the speed
	    of the wrapped code:

	        nothread           9.6s  (no thread code)
		nothreadblock     12.2s  (only 'allow' code)
		nothreadallow     13.6s  (only 'block' code)
                full thread       15.5s  ('allow' + 'block' code)
	    
	    i.e., full thread code decreases the wrapping performance by
	    around 60%. If that is important to your application, you
	    can tune each method using the different 'nothread',
	    'nothreadblock' or 'nothreadallow' features as
	    needed. Note that for some methods deactivating the
	    'thread block' or 'thread allow' code is not an option,
	    so, be careful.

            SWIG library files use system angle brackets everywhere for %include, eg
              %include "std_common.i"
            becomes
              %include <std_common.i>

            [Java, C#]
            Typesafe enums and proper enums have an extra constructor so that enum item values that
            are initialised by another enum item value can be wrapped without having to use %javaconstvalue/
            %csconstvalue for when using %javaconst(1)/%csconst(1). Suggestion by
            Bob Marinier/Douglas Pearson.
            For example:

              typedef enum
              {
                 xyz,
                 last = xyz
              } repeat;

	    [ruby + python]

	    Fixes for directors + pointers. This is an ugly problem without an easy
	    solution. Before we identified this case as problematic:

	          virtual const MyClass& my_method();

            but it turns out that all the cases where a pointer, array or
            reference is returned, are problematic, even for 
	    primitive types (as int, double, char*, etc).

	    To try to fix the issue, a new typemap was added,
	    'directorfree', which is used to 'free' the resources
	    allocated during the 'directorout' phase. At the same
	    time, a primitive garbage collector engine was added to
	    deal with orphaned addresses, when needed.
	    
	    The situation is much better now, but still it is possible to have
	    memory exhaustation if recursion is used.

	    So, still you need to avoid returning pointers, arrays or
	    references when using director methods.

	    - Added stdint.i - typemaps for latest C99 integral types found in stdint.h.
	    
11/14/2005: wsfulton
            More types added to windows.i, eg UINT8, WORD, BYTE etc. 
            Including windows.i will also enable SWIG to parse the __declspec Microsoft
            extension, eg __declspec(dllimport). Also other Windows calling conventions
            such as __stdcall.

11/10/2005: wsfulton
            New library file for Windows - windows.i. This file will contain useful type
            information for users who include windows.h. Initial support is for the
            non ISO integral types: __int8, __int16, __int32, __int64 and unsigned versions.
            The unsigned versions previously could not be parsed by SWIG.  SF #872013.

	    [Allegrocl]
	    Add C++ support to the Allegrocl module. Further
	    enhances the C support as well. Some of the
	    features:

	    - MUCH better generation of foreign types based on
	    the C/C++ types for use in defining the FFI on
	    the lisp side. We don't pass everything as a (* :void)
	    any longer.

	    - Uses typemaps for better control of type conversions
	    and code generation in the generated lisp and c++ wrapper
	    code.

	    - CLOS wrapping of pointers returned from foreign space
	    makes it easier to differentiate pointers in user code.
	    The wrapping objects can be passed directly to FF calls.

	    - Defun wrapping of FF calls, allowing for more lispy
	    interface. Conversion, GCing, of lisp objects to 
	    foreign objects can be done in the wrapping defun via
	    the use of typemaps.
	    
	    - overload dispatching implemented on the lisp side
	    using generic functions.

	    - Templates and synonymous types supported.

11/07/2005: mmatus

	    [Python] Adding proper support for multi-inheritance in
	    the python side, ie, if you have two C++ wrapped class, Foo
	    and Bar, now:

	       class MyPythonClass(Foo,Bar):
	          ....

            will properly work, even with directors, and the
            deallocation of Foo.this and Bar.this will follow
            correctly. Before, a class could only have one 'this'
            instance (unlike C++), only the last base class was
            properly deleted, or detected with directors.

	    Now 'self.this' can be a list, which will contain the C++
	    instance pointers for all the base classes.
	    
	    Also, swig.this is responsible for deallocating the C++
	    instance(s), and the __del__ method is not emitted unless
	    the user preppend/append some code to it.

	  - Swig can now detect memory leaks, ie, if you still
	    don't use proxy/shadow classes, and type something like
	    
	         import _example
	         f = _example.new_Foo()

	    and forget to call _example.delete_Foo(f), then swig will
	    tell you that there is a memory leak.

	    Otherwise, if you always use the proxy classes, you probably
	    you will never ever see this warning unless there is
	    something wrong inside the swig wrapping code.
	       
	
            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
	    
	    If you overloaded the __del__ method, and call the base
	    one	 without a try block, as in

	           class MyClass(SwigClass):

	              def __del__(self):
		          <your code here>
		          SwigClass.__del__(self)
			  
            python could complain that the method SwigClass.__del__ is
            undefined. Try to use instead:
	    
	              def __del__(self):
		          <your code here>
		          try: SwigClass.__del__(self)
			  except: pass

	    or simply 		  

	              def __del__(self):
		          <your code here>

11/02/2005: mmatus

	    [Python] Adding more fun to STL/STD containers, now you
	    can do

	       %template(pyset) std::set<PyObject *>;		
	       %template(pyvector) std::vector<PyObject *>;	
	       %template() std::pair<PyObject *,PyObject *>;	
	       %template(pyvector) std::map<PyObject *,PyObject *>;
	       ....

	    The same  applies to std::list, std::deque, std::multiset, etc.

	    Then, at the python side you can do now:

	       # C++ std::vector as native python sequence
	       v = pyvector([1,"hello",(1,2)])
	       print v[1]
	       >> 'hello'
	       print v[2]
	       >> (1,2)
	       					   
	       # C++ std::set as native python sequence
	       s = pyset()			   
	       s.insert((1,2))		   
	       s.insert(1)			   
	       s.insert("hello")
	       sum=()
	       for i in s:
	         sum +=(i,)
	       print sum
	       >>> (1, 'hello', (1, 2))
	       				   
	       # C++ std::map as native python sequence
	       m = pymap()			   
	       m["foo"] = "hello"		   
	       m[1] = (1,2)
	       pm = {}
	       for k in m:	    	   
	         pm[k] = m[k]
	       print pm
	       >>> {1: (1, 2), 'foo': 'hello'}

	    ie, the STD/STL containers work as real native python
	    container, with arbitrary item types and so.

	    But since normal C++ containers do not properly ref/unref
	    their items, you should use the safer versions:
	    
	      %template(pyset) std::set<swig::PyObject_ptr>;
	      %template(pyvector) std::vector<swig::PyObject_ptr>;
	      %template() std::pair<swig::PyObject_ptr, swig::PyObject_ptr>;
	      %template(pyvector) std::map<swig::PyObject_ptr,swig::PyObject_ptr>;
	      ....

	    where swig::PyObject_ptr is a PyObject * envelope class provided
	    to safely incref/decref the python object. 
	    
	    So, now you can use all the STL/STD containers as native
	    Python containers. 

	    Note 1: std::map, std::set and the other 'ordered'
	    containers will properly use PyObject_Compare for sorting,
	    when needed.

	    Note 2: all the STL/STD containers have a limit size of
	    SIZE_MAX, ie, you can have manage containers larger than
	    INT_MAX, the python limit.
	    
	      
11/02/2005: mmatus

	    [Python]
	    - add 'iterator()' method for all sequences and additionally
	      'key_iterator()' for maps.

	      'iterator()' will always return the native C++ iterator.
	      Additionally, in maps, 'key_iterator()' will return a python
	      iterator using only the map keys.
	      
	      In general the sequence method __iter__ will call
	      'iterator()', returning the native C++ iterator, but in
	      maps it will call 'key_iterator()', maintaining
	      backward compatibility.

	      Hence, for std::maps, you can play then with the native
	      C++ iterator, which value is a (key, value) pair, by
	      calling map.iterator(), as with map.begin(), map.end(), etc.

	      The difference is that map.iterator() returns a safe
	      'closed' iterator, while map.begin() and map.end() are
	      'open' iterators.

	      A 'closed' iterator knows the begin and the end of the
	      sequence, and it never can seg. fault. An 'open'
	      iterator, as in C++, can seg. fault at the C++ side.

	         # a closed iterator is safe in the following example.
		 # the next() method will throw a StopIteration
	         # exception as needed
	
	         i = seq.iterator()
		 try:
                      while True:
		        sum += i.next()
		 except: pass
		 
		 # an open iterator always need to be checked,
		 # or it will crash at the C++ side

	         current = seq.begin()
                 end = seq.end()
		 while (current != end):
		    sum += current.next()
	      
	      
	    [Python]
	    - Finally, when we call 

	        f = Foo()

	      the construction is 'one-way'. Before construction  was done
	      something like

	          Foo() (python) -> _new_Foo() (C++) 
                  new_Foo() (C++) -> FooPtr() (python) 
                  FooPtr() (python) -> Foo() (python)

              and returning a pointer was done like

                  NewPointerObj() (C++) -> FooPtr() (python)
                  FooPtr(python) -> Foo() (python)
                  		  

	      ie, we when going back and forward between the C++ and
	      python side.

	      Now since there is no FooPtr the construction process is

	          Foo() (python) -> _new_Foo() (C++)
                  _new_Foo() (C++) -> NewPointerObj() (C++) (no shadow class)

              and returning a pointer is done

                  NewPointerObj() (C++) (with shadow class) -> NewInstaceObj() (C++)

	      where NewInstanceObj creates a new instance without
	      calling __init__ and it doesn't go 'back' to python, is
	      'pure' C API.

	     - With this change, and the other ones in the
               PySwigObject type, which now carries the thisown and
               swig_type_info pointer, the generated code should be as
               fast as boost::Python and/or the other python wrappers
               based in pure Python/C API calls.

	       As a reference, the profiletest_runme.py example, which
	       does a simple call function many times, such as this code:

                    import profiletest       
		                             
		    a = profiletest.A()      
		    b = profiletest.B()      
		    for i in range(0,1000000)
	              a = b.fn(a)            


	       where fn is defined as 'A* B::fn(A *a) {return a;}',
	       produces  the following times

                               nomodern    modern
	         swig-1.3.26    19.70s      5.98s
                 swig-CVS        0.99s      0.98s
	       

	       Clearly, there is a large improvement for the python
	       'nomodern' mode. Still, the 'modern' mode is around
	       6 times faster than before. For the same test, but
	       using the non-shadow version of the module, we get

	                       _profiletest (non-shadow)
	         swig-1.3.26     0.80s 
                 swig-CVS        0.60s 

	       Hence, now for practical purposes, the proxy overhead
	       is insignificant.

	       Note that the performance numbers we are showing is for
	       a simple module (two types) and a simple function (one
	       argument). For real situations, for modules with many
	       more types and/or functions with many more parameters,
	       you will see even better results.

	    - Finally, no more ClassPtr proxy classes. You will see
	      only a clean Class proxy class in the .py file.

	    - No more 'real' thisown attribute either, the PySwigObject now
              carries the ownership info.

	      You can also do something like

	          print self.this.own() 
		  >>> True
		  
		  self.this.disown()
		  self.this.own(0)
	          print self.this.own() 
		  >>> False		  

		  self.this.acquire()
		  self.this.own(1)
	          print self.this.own() 
		  >>> True

	      Still the old way,
	      
	          print self.thisown
		  >>> True

		  self.thisown = 0
	          print self.thisown
		  >>> False		  

		  self.thisown = 1
	          print self.thisown
		  >>> True

              is supported, and python dispatches the proper method
              calls as needed. 		  
	       

	    - Support for iterators in STL/STD containers, for example, if you have

                    %template<set_string> std::set<std::string>;
	          
               you can use the C++ iterators as:  

                     s = set_string()
		                     
		     s.append("c")   
		     s.append("a")   
	             s.append("b")

                     b = s.begin()      
		     e = s.end()        
		     sum = ""           
		     while (b != e):    
                         sum += b.next()        
                     print sum

                     >>> "abc" 

		advance the iterator as in C++

                     current = s.begin()      
		     current += 1
                     print current.value()
		     >>> "b"
		     
		now using the reverse operators

                     b = s.rbegin()      
		     e = s.rend()        
		     sum = ""           
		     while (b != e):    
                         sum += b.next()        
                     print sum

                     >>> "cba" 

	        or the 'previous' method

                     b = s.begin()      
		     e = s.end()        
		     sum = ""           
		     while (b != e):    
                         sum += e.previous()
                     print sum

                     >>> "cba" 

                or just as in a python fashion

                     for i in s:
                         sum += i        
                           
                Note 1: Iterators in C++ are very powerful, but
                dangerous too. And in python you can shoot yourself in the foot
                just like in C++, so, be careful.
		
		Note 2: the iterators are 'light', ie, they do not
		convert sequence elements until you request to do so, via
		next(), value() or previous(). If you just increment/decrement one
		no conversion is performed, for example:

                      
                     b = s.begin()      
	             b += 1
                     b.incr()
                     b.incr(2)
		     b.decr(2)
                     b.decr()
                     b -= 1

		 only the iterator is modified, and not value wrapper
		 is generated. Other typical C++ operations are also 
		 available, such as:

		     print s.end() - s.begin()
		     >>> 3
		     f = s.begin() + 1
		     print f.value()
		     >>> "b"
		     l = s.end() - 1
		     print l.value()
		     >>> "c"
		 
		 etc.  Of course, the 'find', 'insert', 'erase', and
		 so on methods also supports iterators now, ie:

		      i = s.begin()
		      i += 1
		      s.erase(i)
                      for i in s:
                         sum += i

	    There is no more 'thisown' attribute. If you use it, python
	    will translate the following code as follows:

                if (self.thisown):   ==>   if (self.this.own()):
		self.thisown = 1     ==>   self.this.own(1)
                self.thisown = 0     ==>   self.this.own(0)

	    Still, maybe in some unusual cases the translation will not be
	    100% correct, so if you have a problem, please report it
	    and/or use the new 'self.this.own()' accessor.

	    There is no more ClassPtr classes in the python code. Hence,
	    if in the past you needed to resort to some kind of trickery
	    with them, or overcome their presence, it is no longer
	    required, but the extra code you added could now break
	    things.

	    If needed, you can use the option -classptr, i.e.,

               swig -classptr -python ...

	    to generate the old ClassPtr classes.

	    [Guile] Make declared and defined linkage of SWIG_init consistent.  
	    Reported by Steven G. Johnson (SF patch 1315498).

10/26/2005: mmatus

	  - Added the attribute.i file to the global library director.
	    Now it can be used from other languages that do not use
	    the unified typemap library as well.

	    So, if you have something like:

	       %include attribute.i

               %attribute(A, int, a, get_a, set_a);
	       				      	  
	       struct A			      	  
	       {    				  
	         int get_a() const; 		  
	         void set_a(int aa); 		  
	       };				  

               %attribute_ref(B, int, c);
	       				
	       struct B			
	       {    			
	         int& c(); 		
	       }; 

	    then in the target language the 'A.a' and 'B.c' attributes will
	    be visible, ie, you can access them as plain variables:

               f   = A()
               f.a = 3
               g   = B()
               g.c = 3 
           
	       h   = f.a + g.c

	    and the proper get/set methods will be dispatched. See
	    attribute.i for more info.
   
          - More cleanups around and adding more test-cases. The
            DISOWN typemap now is tested and working in all the
            languages that use the unified typemap library, ie, tcl,
            ruby, perl and python.
	    

10/25/2005: mmatus

	    - Perl, complete the DISOWN typemap.
	    
	    - added the attribute.i file to the unified typemap
              library (before was only usable from python).

	    - unify the names for the setter and getter methods in
	      perl,tcl,ruby and python, so, the attribute.i library
	      can work across them.
	      
	    - see the li_attribute.i test-case or the library file

 	        Lib/typemaps/attribute.swg

              for more info about how to use it.

 
	      

10/24/2005: mmatus

	    - Perl now uses the unified typemap library.

	    - Changes in ruby to use the $track option in typemaps.

	    - Changes in the unified typemap library to follow the
	      convention that all macros that are not used in the
	      C/C++ side starts with %, such as

	           %delete
		   %new_array

              etc.
	      
	    - Documenting fragments, see fragments.swg.

	    - Cleaner way to use the unified typemap library, include
	      just <typemaps/swigtypes.swg>.

	      Check some of the supported languages: perl, tcl, ruby,
	      python.

	      Always start with the head file, such as

	         python/python.swg
	         tcl/tcl8.swg
	         ruby/ruby.swg
	         perl5/perl5.swg

              and the principal file that invokes the unified library, such as

	         python/pytypemaps.swg	    
	         tcl/tcltypemaps.swg	    
	         ruby/rubytypemaps.swg	    
	         perl/perltypemaps.swg	    
	    
	      The file that provide the specialization for each
	      language are the one that provides the basic types:

	         python/pyprimtypes.swg	
	         ruby/rubyprimtypes.swg	
	         tcl/tclprimtypes.swg	
	         perl5/perlprimtypes.swg

	      and the string manipulation:  	 
	    
	         python/pystrings.swg	
	         ruby/rubystrings.swg	
	         tcl/tclstrings.swg	
	         perl5/perlstrings.swg

		 
	      The rest of the files, such as carray.i, are mostly one 
	      line files that include the proper typemap library
	      version.

	      gcc -O3 easily.

	    - Finalize the typemaps library. All the old  *.i files
	      (carray.i, cpointer.i, exception.i) had been implemented
	      in the new typemaps library.

	    Chicken:
	      - Correctly handle %ignored classes
              - Correctly convert long, long long, unsigned long, etc
                to chicken primitives. (Thanks to Felix Winkelmann)
              - Using argout parameters when the return value was a
                wrapped pointer caused a memory corruption.  The chicken
                garbage collector moved a pointer out from under us.
                This is now fixed by running all the proxy creation
                functions as continuations after the wrapper function
                returns.  As part of this, we no longer need the
                chickenfastproxy flag on output typemaps.
              - using -proxy and -nocollection together works now
                Before, it was not exporting the destructor in the proxy
                wrapper.

10/18/2005: mmatus
	    
	    Added the Unified Typemap Library (UTL). It unifies the typemaps for

 	        python, ruby, tcl

	    and in the process, fixes several problems in each of the three
	    languages to work in a "canonical" way now established in
	    the typemap library
	    
	       SWIG/Lib/typempas

	    The current status of the unification is that everything
	    compiles and runs inside the test-suite and examples
	    directories. And for the first time we have three
	    languages than pass the primitive_types.i case.

	    Also, we have a uniform way to treat the errors, for example
	    if you do something like

	      >>> from primitive_types import *
              >>> print val_uchar(10)
              10
	      >>> print val_uchar(1000)
              Traceback (most recent call last):		      
	        File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?			    
	      OverflowError: in argument 1 of type 'unsigned char'

	    you get the same exception in all the three languages.
	    
	    And well, many more good things will come from this
	    unification, for example, proper support of the STL/STD classes
	    for all the languages, and hopefully, we can keep
	    adding other languages.

	    The hardest part, writing a common typemap library
	    that suites the three different languages, is done,
	    and adding another language should now be easy. 

	    Still the global unification is not complete, the STL/STD 
	    part is next, and probably as well as adding one or two more
	    languages.

	    If you are curious, look at the python, ruby and/or tcl
	    directories to see what is needed to support the new
	    common typemaps library.  Still, the final way to
	    integrate a new language could change as we move to
	    integrate the STD/STL.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY in Ruby/Tcl ***

	    Some missing/wrong typemaps could start working properly,
	    and change the old behavior, specially in ruby and tcl.

Version 1.3.27 (October 15, 2005)
=================================

10/15/2005: wsfulton
            [Java] Fix for typesafe enum wrapping so that it is possible to
            overload a method with 2 different enum types.

10/15/2005: wsfulton
            Fix for %feature("immutable","0") attempting to generate setters
            for constants.

            Restored %immutable and %makedefault to clear the feature as it
            behaved in SWIG-1.3.25 and earlier.

10/14/2005: mmatus
            Fix bug in anonymous typedef structures which was leading to
            strange behaviour.

10/13/2005: mmatus
	    Several minor changes:
	    
	    - Improve the wchar_t type support
	    - Add a warning for when you define the 'in' typemap but
	      you don't define the 'typecheck' one. Very common mistake.
	    - Add proper default rule for function pointers, now you
	      can define a typemap such as:

	      %typemap(in) SWIGTYPE ((*)(ANY)) {...}

	      That will apply to all the pointer to functions. The
	      rule in C++ also apply to the function 'reference', ie,
	      in both cases

	        typedef  int (*fptr)(int a);
	        typedef  int (func)(int a);

	      This was needed since it seems to be 'illegal' in C++ to
	      do something like:

	         void *ptr = static_cast<void *>(fptr);

	      and probably, as for member functions, it is not
	      warrantied that the pointer sizes will match.

	    - Add the #error/#warning directives to swig's cpp.

	    - Add the noblock option for typemaps, which is used as
              follows: supposed you a typemap, like this

	      
	      %typemap(in,noblock=1) Hello {			   
	         ....
              }

	      then the typemap will be inserted without the block
	      imposed by the brackets, similar to

	       %typemap(in) Hello "...";

	      So, why you don't just use the quote style?, because:
	      
	         1.- The quote style doesn't get preprocessed, for example
	      
	              %typemap(in) Hello "$1= SWIG_macro($1);";
	      
	             here, SWIG_macro doesn't get expanded

                 2.- Inside a quote typemap, you have to use 
                     quotes carefully

		      %typemap(in) Hello "$1 = \"hello\" ";

		 3.- You can't make emacs and/or other editors
		     to indent inside a string!. 


	      So, why do you want to remove the block?, because an extra
	      block when not needed (no local variables in it):

	          1.- makes the code harder to read
                  2.- makes the code larger
                  3.- or in short, for the same reason we have the quote style.

Version 1.3.26 (October 9, 2005)
================================

10/08/2005: wsfulton
            [Php] Added 'throws' typemaps.

10/08/2005: wsfulton
            Fixes for languages that don't support multiple inheritance. The
            first non-ignored class in the public base class list is used for inheritance.
            by the proxy class. Previously, if the first class in the list was ignored, then
            the proxy class wouldn't have any base classes.

10/07/2005: mmatus
	     Update more features to follow new convention, including:

	       callback
	       ref/unref
	       except
	    
	     All of them use not only the feature as a flag, but also
	     as code value. To deal with those features, we use now
	     GetFlagAttr, which is similar to GetFlag, but instead or
	     returning 1 or 0, it returns the attr value, if happens
	     to be different of "0" of course.

	     Now there are also more uniform directive names for the 
	     ones based in features, for example, for the old
	     %newobject directive now we have tree directives defined:
	     

	     #define %newobject        %feature("new")
	     #define %nonewobject      %feature("new","0")
	     #define %clearnewobject   %feature("new","")

	     and so on for all the other feature directives.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

09/30/2005: wsfulton
            Subtle change to some features. Previously it was not possible to disable many
            features once they had been enabled. This was for most features that behave as
            flags. These features now work as follows:

              %feature("name")              // enables the feature
              %feature("name", "1")         // enables the feature
              %feature("name", "0")         // disables the feature
              %feature("name", "")          // clears the feature

            In fact any non-empty value other than "0" will enable the feature (like C boolean logic).
            Previously "1", "0" or any other non-empty value would enable the feature and it would
            only be possible to disable the feature by clearing it (assuming there was no global enable).

            The following features are affected:

              allowexcept
              compactdefaultargs
              classic                (Python)

              java:const             (Java)
              java:downcast          (Java)
              kwargs
              modern                 (Python)
              new
              noautodoc              (Python)
              nodefault
              nodirector
              noref
              notabstract
              nounref
              novaluewrapper
              python:maybecall       (Python)
              python:nondynamic      (Python)
              modula3:multiretval    (Modula3)
              predicate              (Ruby)
              trackobjects           (Ruby)
              valuewrapper

            It is now possible, for example to ignore all methods/classes in a header file, except for a
            few targetted methods, for example:

              %feature("ignore");                                // ignore all methods/classes
              %feature("ignore","0") some_function(int, double); // do not ignore this function
              %feature("ignore","0") SomeClass;                  // do not ignore this Class
              %feature("ignore","0") SomeClass::method;          // do not ignore this method
              %include "bigheader.h"

            Removed %pythondynamic - it never worked properly. Use %pythonnondynamic instead.
            Removed %feature("nokwargs") - it wasn't fully implemented  - use %feature("kwargs","0") instead.

            Adding the module option to the %import directive. Now you
            can use it as

	        %import(module="BigModule") foo.i

	    where subfile could (or not) define the module name via
	    the %module directive. The module option take precedence
	    and it has the same effects than having the directive 

	        %module BigModule  

	    inside the imported file foo.i.

	    You can use the option in mainly two cases:

	    1.- You used the -module option when you generated the
                module to be imported, and hence the module name in
                the imported %module directive is not really useful.

	    2.- The module you want to import is very large, and it
                has several .i/.h files. Then, if you just one to
                import a class or so from the module, says 'foo', and
                not the entire module via importing the main
                BigModule.i file, then you just do:

 		    %import(module="BigModule") foo.h

   	        or
		
 		    %import(module="BigModule") foo.i

		where foo.i contains the 'foo' declaration and maybe a
		couple of extra %include directives, as needed.

            Modifications to STL wrappers so that it is possible for a user's %exception directive
            to be applied to the STL wrapper methods. Previously the following global %exception
            directive would not be used on the wrapper methods:

                %exception { 
                  try {
                    $action
                  } catch (...) {
                    // handle uncaught exceptions
                  }
                }

            This has been implemented by replacing %exception directives for specific STL wrapper
            methods with an exception specification declared on the wrapper methods. throws typemaps
            are now supplied for handling the STL exception specification. These can also be easily
            overridden, for example the std::out_of_range exception, which is used a lot in the STL
            wrappers, can be customised easily:

              %include "std_vector.i"
              %typemap(throws) std::out_of_range {
                // custom exception handler
              }
              %template(VectInt) std::vector<int>;

            [CLISP] The clisp module for SWIG:
              - It can only handle C, clisp currently does not supports ffi bindings to C++.
              - It has two options, (a) -extern-all this will generate wrappers for all functions
        	and variablestions, (b) -generate-typedef this will generate wrappers "def-c-type"
	        wrappers for typedefs
	      - Can handle pointers to functions, complex types such as n-dimensional arrays of 
	 	pointers of depth d
	      - Generates wrappers for constants as well as variables
	      - Correctly distinguishes between the declaration of variables in structures and functions
	      - Creates a defpackage "declaration" with the module name as the package name, the created 
	    	package exports both functions and variables
	      - tries to guess when should a pointer variable be declared as c-ptr or c-pointer

07/22/2005: wsfulton
            [C#] Changes to support C# structs returned by value. The changes required are:
              - Using an optional 'null' attribute in the out typemap. If this attribute is specified,
                then it is used for the $null special variable substitution.
              - The ctype used in the C/C++ wrappers is no longer initialised to 0 on declaration.
            Both of these changes fix the situations where an attempt was made to assign 0 to the
            returned struct. Marshalling structs as value types still requires user defined typemaps.
            See documentation for an example.

07/22/2005: wsfulton
            [C#, Java] Fix SWIG_exception usage to work with compilers that don't support empty macro

            that use "" or %{ %} delimiters, but continues to work with typemaps using {} delimiters.
            Please use the SWIG_CSharpSetPendingExceptionArgument or SWIG_JavaThrowException methods instead
            as SWIG_exception is really intended as a platform independent macro for the SWIG library writers.

06/27/2005: wsfulton
            Functions declared as 'extern' no longer have an additional function declaration added to the 
            wrapper files. There are some cases where SWIG does not get this right, eg bug #1205859 (extern
            functions with default arguments declared in a namespace). Also SWIG cannot get non-standard
            calling conventions correct, eg Windows calling conventions are usually handled like this:

              %{
              #define DLLIMPORT __declspec(dllimport)
              #define STDCALL __stdcall
              %}
              #define DLLIMPORT
              #define STDCALL
              %inline %{
              DLLIMPORT extern STDCALL void function(int);
              %}

            SWIG incorrectly generates:

            extern void function(int);

            To which there is no solution as SWIG doesn't handle non-standard calling conventions. The extra
            'extern' function that SWIG generates is superfluous unless a user has forgotten to add the function
            declaration into the wrappers.

            The -noextern commandline argument is now redundant and a new commandline argument -addextern can
            be used to obtain the original behaviour. This shouldn't be necessary unless the header file
            containing the function declaration was inadvertently not added to the wrappers. To fix this
            add the function declaration into your wrappers, For example, replace:

              extern void foo(int);

            with:

              %inline %{
              extern void foo(int);
              %}

            [C#, Java, Modula3, Ocaml]
            The intermediary function names have been changed when wrapping variables to
            match the other language modules so that %extend for a member variable works
            uniformly across all language modules, eg:

              %extend ExtendMe {
                Var;
              };

              %{
                void ExtendMe_Var_set(ExtendMe *, double) {...}
                double ExtendMe_Var_get(ExtendMe *) {...}
              %}

            The methods implementing the get/set used to be:

              %{
                void set_ExtendMe_Var(ExtendMe *, double) {...}
                double get_ExtendMe_Var(ExtendMe *) {...}
              %}

            This also changes the name of variable wrapper functions when using -noproxy.
            The original names can be generated with the -oldvarnames commandline option.

04/28/2005: wsfulton
            [C#] Fixed problems due to the over eager garbage collector. Occasionally the
            garbage collector would collect a C# proxy class instance while it was being used
            in unmanaged code if the object was passed as a parameter to a wrapped function.
            Needless to say this caused havoc as the C# proxy class calls the C++ destructor
            when it is collected. Proxy classes and type wrapper classes now use a HandleRef,
            which holds an IntPtr, instead of a plain IntPtr to marshal the C++ pointer to unmanaged
            code. There doesn't appear to be any performance degradation as a result of this
            modification.

            The changes are in the proxy and type wrapper classes. The swigCPtr is now of type HandleRef
            instead of IntPtr and consequently the getCPtr method return type has also changed. The net
            effect is that any custom written typemaps might have to be modified to suite. Affected users
            should note that the implementation uses the new 'out' attribute in the imtype typemap as the
            input type is now a HandleRef and the output type is still an IntPtr.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR C# MODULE ***

04/28/2005: wsfulton
            [C#] Support for asymmetric type marshalling added. Sometimes the output type needs to be
            different to the input type. Support for this comes in the form of a new optional 'out'
            attribute for the ctype, imtype and cstype typemaps. If this typemap attribute is not
            specified, then the type used for both input and output is the type specified in the
            typemap, as has always previously been the case. If this typemap attribute is specified,
            then the type specified in the attribute is used for output types and the type specified
            in the typemap itself is used for the input type. An output type is a return value from
            a wrapped method or wrapped constant and an input type is a parameter in a wrapped method.

            An example shows that char * could be marshalled in different ways, 

              %typemap(imtype, out="IntPtr") char * "string"
              char * function(char *);

            The output type is thus IntPtr and the input type is string. The resulting intermediary C# code is:

              public static extern IntPtr function(string jarg1);

            when wrapping C++ enum references, as reported by Admire Kandawasvika.

            [Perl] SF #1124490. Fix Perl macro clashes when using Visual Studio's STL string,
            so now projects can #include <string>.

03/21/2005: wsfulton
            Fixed %varargs which got broken with the recent default argument changes.
            Also works for Java and C# for the first time now.

            [Chicken] 
	    + Fix a whole bunch of bugs in the chicken module.  The entire
              test suite now compiles, with the exception of the tests that require
	      std_vector.i, std_deque.i, and so on, which chicken does not have yet.

	    + Add support for %exception and %typemap(exceptions).  Exceptions are
	      thrown with a call to (abort) and can be handled by (handle-exceptions)

03/15/2005: wsfulton
            [Java] Patch from Scott Michel for directors. Modifications to the typemaps
            giving users fine control over memory ownership and lifetime of director classes.
            Director classes no longer live forever by default as they are now collectable
            by the GC.

03/15/2005: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
	    [Chicken] Add support for adding finalizers garbage collected objects.
	    Functions that return new objects should be marked with %newobject and
	    input arguments which consume (or take ownership) of a pointer should
	    be marked with the DISOWN typemap.

	    Also add support for correctly checking the number of arguments passed
	    to a function, and raising an error if the wrong number are passed.

03/14/2005: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
            Add --without-alllang option to configure.in, which is the same as
            passing all the --without-python --without-perl5 etc... that Matthias added.

            [C#] Fix undefined behaviour after any of the std::vector methods

03/07/2005: wsfulton
            [C#] When null is passed for a C++ reference or value parameter, the 
            exception thrown has been corrected to an ArgumentNullException instead
            of NullReferenceException as recommended in the .NET Framework documentation.

            The default throws typemaps turn a C++ exception into an ApplicationException,
            not a SystemException now.

03/07/2005: wsfulton
            [C#] Numerous changes in C# exception handling have been made over the past
            few weeks. A summary follows:

            The way in which C++ exceptions are mapped to C# exceptions is quite different.
            The change is to fix C# exceptions so that the C++ exception stack is correctly
            unwound as previously C++ exceptions were being thrown across the C PInvoke layer
            into the managed world.

            New typemap attributes (canthrow and excode) have been introduced to control the
            mapping of C++ to C# exceptions. Essentially a callback into the unmanaged world
            is made to set a pending exception. The exception to throw is stored in thread local
            storage (so the approach is thread-safe). The typemaps are expected to return
            from unmanaged code as soon as the pending exception is set. Any pending exceptions
            are checked for and thrown once managed code starts executing. There should
            be minimal impact on execution speed during normal behaviour. Full details will be
            documented in CSharp.html.

            The SWIG_CSharpThrowException() function has been removed and replaced with the
            SWIG_CSharpSetPendingExceptionArgument() and SWIG_CSharpSetPendingException()
            functions. The original name has been deliberately changed to break old code as
            the old approach was somewhat flawed. Any user defined exceptions that follow the
            same pattern as the old approach should also be fixed.

            Numerous new .NET framework exceptions are now available for easy throwing from 
            unmanaged code. The complete list is: 

              ApplicationException, ArithmeticException, DivideByZeroException, 
              IndexOutOfRangeException, InvalidOperationException, IOException, 
              NullReferenceException, OutOfMemoryException, OverflowException, 
              SystemException, ArgumentException, ArgumentNullException and
              ArgumentOutOfRangeException.

	    Fix several memory leaks around. Even when we survive  knowning
	    swig is a memory leak factory, it was a little out of
	    control. To run std_containers.i in the python test-suite,
	    swig was using ~260MB, now it uses 'only' ~40MB, which is
	    the same ammount that g++ uses, so, is not that bad.
	    In the process, I found a couple of extra Deletes, which
	    in some cases could trigger seg. faults and/or
	    DOH/asserts.
	    
	    [python] Better support for directors + exception. More
	    verbose errors and added an unexpected exception handler.

02/25/2005: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
	    Update documentation to use CSS and <div> instead of <blockquote>
	    I used a script to convert the docs, and it set all the box classes
	    to be "code".  There are actually 4 different classes,
	    "shell", "code", "targetlang", and "diagram".  We need to go through
	    and convert the divs depending on what they contain.

02/23/2005: mmatus

	    [Python] Added option -nortti to disable the use of native
	    C++ RTTI with directors (dynamic_cast<> is not used).

	    Add more code for directors to detect and report errors in
	    the python side.

	    Extend the use of SWIGINTERN whenever is possible.

	    Remove template warnings reported by VC7.1.

	    Remove warnings reported by gcc/g++. Finally you can
	    compile using

	       g++ -W -Wall -c mymodule_wrap.cxx

	    and no spurious errors will be generated in the wrapper
	    code.

02/23/2005: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
	    Added -external-runtime argument.  This argument is used to dump

            - Add DohSortList to DOH
	    
	    - Improve the runtime type system:
               + Speed. Type loading is now O(n log n) instead of O(N^2), which
	         for large modules is a huge improvement.
               + A whole bunch of functions in swigrun.swg no longer need the 
                 swig_type_list_handle passed to them.  The only one left is 
		 TypeQuery.  This also makes runtime.swg a lot smaller.
	       + Split up swig_type_info structure into two structures
	         (swig_type_info and swig_cast_info)
	       + Store a pointer to a swig_type_info rather than just the type
	         name string in the linked list of casts. First off, this makes
	         the guile module a little faster, and second, the
	         SWIG_TypeClientData() function is faster too. 
	       + Add the idea of a module into the type system.  Before, all the
	         types were stored in one huge linked list. Now, another level is
	         added, and the type system stores a linked list of modules, each
	         of which stores an array of types associated with it.
	       + For more information of how the runtime type system now works,
	         please see Doc/Manual/typemaps.html and Doc/Devel/runtime.txt
		 
	    - Update all language modules to use the new type system.  The changes
	      to each language module are minor.  All languages are now able to
	      use runtime.swg for external access to the type system.  Before
	      only python and perl did.

	    - [guile, mzscheme, ocaml, and php4]  These languages opened up the
	      init function inside the .cxx code, and any code in the .swg files
	      in the init section was inside this function.  This was a problem
	      for swiginit.swg, which needs to be inserted before the SWIG_init
	      function is opened.  Thus I changed these languages to be like
	      python or perl, where the init function is declared in the .swg
	      file.
	      
	    - [Ruby] Instead of moving the init function to the .swg file, I
	      added a new section initbeforefunc, and then added
	      %insert(initbeforefunc) "swiginit.swg"

	    - [MzScheme] Fix enums and fix Examples/Makefile.in so that if
	      multiple -I arguments are specified in the INCLUDES variable, each
	      gets a ++ccf.

	    - [Guile GH] Update Guile GH to use the new type system.  See
	      Doc/Manual/Guile.html for how smobs are now used.

01/11/2005: wsfulton
            [C#] New typemap called 'csconstruct'. The code in this typemaps was previously hard
            coded and could not be customised by a user. This typemap contains the code that is
            generated into a proxy class's constructor.

            [Java] New typemap called 'javaconstruct'. The code in this typemaps was previously hard
            coded and could not be customised by a user. This typemap contains the code that is
            generated into a proxy class's constructor. Another typemap named 'javaconstruct_director'
            is used instead when the proxy class is a director class.

            [C#, Java] If a C++ class did not have a default constructor, a protected default constructor
            was automatically generated by SWIG. This seems is unnecessary and has been removed
            and thereby giving the user almost complete control over the generated code along with the
            new typemaps above.

19/12/2004: mmatus
            [Disabled, see entry 02/15/2004]
            - Fix typemap search, now the "out" typemap search is done as follows

                 int *Foo::foo(int bar)   ->  int *Foo::foo(int bar)
                                          ->  int *Foo::foo
                                          ->  int *foo(int bar)
                                          ->  int *foo
                                          ->  int *

               then, now you can be more specific, and define

              /* apply only for  'Foo::foo' method */
              %typemap(out) int * Foo::foo(int *bar) ...; 

              /* apply for all 'foo' functions/methods */
              %typemap(out) int * foo(int *bar) ...; 

              %inline {
                struct Foo {
                   int *foo(int *bar);
                };
              }

	    - Finishing the fixes for templates + default template
	      args + specializations.

            - [Python] Now we use the new templates + default template
	      args in the std/STL library. That means the internal
	      swig files are getting uglier since we now support the
	      original declarations:

	        template<class _Tp, class _Alloc = std::allocator< _Tp > >
		class vector {
		....
		};
	      	     
                template<class _Key, class _Tp, class _Compare = std::less<_Key >,
	        class _Alloc = std::allocator<std::pair<const _Key, _Tp > > >
                class map {
		....
		};
 
              and the user can use the %template directive as

	        %template() std::vector<int>;
	        %template() std::vector<int, std::allocator<int> >;
	        %template() std::vector<int, MyAllocator<int> >;

              Now we are closer to the cleaning/rewriting of the
	      python std/STL support, such that we recover support for
	      MSVC++ 6.0, and we can add support for other languages
	      too.


12/02/2004: wsfulton
            [Java] Fix for directors when wrapping methods using a member enum
            and typesafe/proper enums enabled.

12/01/2004: mmatus
	    - Fix typemaps to work with templates and default template
	      args, ie

	       template <class A, class B = int>
               struct Foo {
	       };

	       %typemap(in) Foo<int> *{...}
	       %typemap(out) Foo<int,int> *{...}

	       Foo<int> * foo( Foo<int> *f1, Foo<int,int> *f2);

	      now 'f1', 'f2' and the return value resolve the provided
	      typemaps properly.

	      This is highly needed for proper STL support, see new 
	      std_basic_string.i, std_sstream.i, etc.

	    - Added std_sstream.i, and fix std_basic_string.i to use
	      the new typemaps + template def. arg mechanism. Also,
	      added the needed std_alloc.i. Now, all the containers
	      can be modified to support std::allocator, like in:
	      
	        template<class T, class A = std::allocator<T > >
		class vector {
		public:
		....
		};
	      
	      This change is only completed by now for basic_string.

	    - Fix for smart pointers + members + extensions:

	      %extend Foo {
	        int extension(int i, int j) { return i; }
		int extension() { return 1; }
	      }

	      %inline %{

	      class Foo {
	      public:
		int y;
		static const int z;
	      };
  
	      class Bar {
	        Foo *f;
	      public:
	        Bar(Foo *f) : f(f) { }
		Foo *operator->() {
		  return f;
		}
	      };

	      now you can 
	     
	      f = Foo()
	      f.y = 3
	      a = f.z
	      f->extension()
 
	      b = Bar(f)
	      b.y = 3
	      a = b.z
	      b->extension()

	    - Other small errors fixes, mostly python.

            [Java] Numerous director bug fixes so that the correct java types
            and canonicalized types in the JNI code are emitted. Use of the
            $javaclassname special variables in the director typemaps now
            consistent with the non-director typemaps. The types used for 
            typemap lookups are also corrected in a few places. If you 
            previously had your own director typemaps, ensure they are using the
            correct C++ type.

            const enum SWIGTYPE & typemaps added. These wrap const enum references
            as if they were passed by value. Const enum references thus work the
            same as const reference primitive types such as const double &, 
            const int & etc. Typemaps added for Java, C#, Ruby, Tcl, Perl and Pike.

11/25/2004: wsfulton
            [Java, C#] New special variable: $*javaclassname, similar to $javaclassname
            and $&javaclassname. The new one removes a pointer from the C type before
            obtaining the Java class name. One or more of $javaclassname,
            $&javaclassname or $*javaclassname may now appear in a typemap. Likewise for
            C# using csclassname instead of javaclassname.

11/25/2004: wsfulton
            The last vestiges of enums being handled as integers removed from the
            internals. The wrapper methods use the enum type rather than an int
            now. The net result is added type safety for enums when handled as
            pointers, references etc. Previously in situations such as a method
            taking a pointer to an enum, a pointer to an int or a pointer to an
            enum of some other type could inadvertantly be passed to the method.
            This is now fixed as the descriptor for an enum is no longer based on
            an int, but the enum type instead. Anonymous enums are still handled
            as integers.

            The consequence for scripting language users in correct usage of enums
            should not be noticeable. There is no change for any of the languages
            where enums are passed by value - most of the scripting languages will
            still accept an integer for an enum value and the strongly typed
            languages still use either typesafe enums, integers or proper enums
            depending on what the user configures. For Java and C# users a change
            in the typewrapper class name has occurred (for enum pointers,
            references etc). For example:

              enum Numbers { one=1, two };
              enum Numbers* number();

            In Java and C# this must now be coded as

              SWIGTYPE_p_Numbers n = modulename.number();

            rather than

              SWIGTYPE_p_int n = modulename.number();

            Added missing deprecated warning for %name and remove remaining %name
            usage in the SWIG libraries.

11/21/04: mmatus
	    - [Python] Adding the PySwigObject to be used for carrying
	      the instance C/C++ pointers. This is used instead of
	      string and PyCObjects.

	      The new PySwigObject is even safer than PyCObject, and
	      more friendly than plain strings:

	      now you can do

	        print a.this
		<Swig Object at _00691608_p_A>

		print str(a.this)
		_00691608_p_A

		print long(a.this)
		135686400

		print "%s 0x%x" % (a.this, a.this)
		_00691608_p_A 0x8166900

	      the last one is very useful when debugging the C/C++
	      side, since is the pointer value you will usually get
	      from the debugger.

	      Also, if you have some old code that uses the string
	      representation "_00691608_p_A", you can use it now again
	      using 'str(ptr)', or by calling 'str = PyObject_Str(obj)'
	      in the C/C++ side.
 
	      This change is mainly for nostalgic swig users that miss
	      the string representation, but also allows to say again

	        if a.this == b.this:
		  return "a is b"

	      and well, since the change were really simple, maybe in
	      the future we will be able to do
   
		next = a.this + 1

	      or add native python iteration over native C/C++ arrays,
	      ie, no need to create/copy new tuples when returning and
	      array or vector.

	      Also, a PySwigPacked object was adding to carry a member
	      method pointer, but this is probably a temporal solution
	      until a more general object for methods is added.

	      Be aware that to simplify maintaining and compatibility
	      with other tools, the old string and PyCObjects
	      representation could disappear very soon, and the
	      SWIG_COBJECTS_TYPES or SWIG_NO_OBJECT_TYPES macros will
	      have no effect at compilation time. Still, the three
	      mechanisms are present in the code just for testing,
	      debugging and comparison purposes.

	    - [Python] Adding back support for using the swig runtime code
	      inside the user code. We just allow the user to include
	      the minimal code needed to implement the runtime
	      mechanism statically, just as in done in the swig
	      modules.
	      
	      To use the swig runtime code, for example with python,
	      the user needs include the following:
 
               #include <Python.h>         // or using your favorite language
               #include <swigrun.swg>
               #include <python/pyrun.swg> // or using your favorite language
               #include <runtime.swg>

	      the files swigrun.swg, pyrun.swg and runtime.swg can 
	      be checked out by using swig -co, or they can simply 
	      be found by adding the swig lib directory to the
	      compiler include directory list, for example

	       SWIGLIB=`swig -swiglib`
	       c++ -I${SWIGLIB} ..

	      of better, using the CPPFLAGS, but that depends on your
	      environment.
	       
	      This change can be ported to the other languages too,
	      you just need to isolate the needed runtime code in
	      a single file like 'pyrun.swg', and provide the 
	      SWIG_Runtime_GetTypeList() method. Look at the
	      Lib/python/pyrun.swg file and the Examples/python/swigrun
	      example.

11/15/04: mmatus
	    - Fix mixed_types.i + gcc-3.4, ie, arrays + references +
	      typedefs

	    - Fix multidim arrays + typedefs,ie

	       typedef char character[1];
	       typedef character word[64];

	    - Process protected/private bases in the same way before
	      we process protected/private members, ie, we check
	      for constructors, operator new, virtual members, etc.
   
	    - Fix Ruby/Java to work (or ignore) multi-inheritance +
              directors. Allow other languages to define if it is
              supported or not.
	    
	    - Now you can run

                SWIG_FEATURES="-directors -dirprot" 
                make check-ruby-test-suite
                make check-python-test-suite
                make check-java-test-suite
                make check-ocaml-test-suite

	      and you will get only 'real' errors. ruby and python
	      compile with no errors, java shows some problems.	

Version 1.3.23 (November 11, 2004)
==================================

11/05/2004: wsfulton
            Patch #982753 from Fabrice Salvaire: Adds dependencies generation for
            constructing makefiles. New command line options -MF -MD -MMD to work
            with the current options -M and -MM. These options are named the same
            and work the same as in gcc.

            %ignore/%rename changes for methods with default arguments to mirror
            %feature behaviour. See previous entry.

                      *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

11/04/2004: wsfulton
            %feature improvements for fine tuning when wrapping methods with
            default arguments. Any %feature targeting a method with default arguments
            will apply to all the extra overloaded methods that SWIG generates if the
            default arguments are specified in the feature. If the default arguments are
            not specified in the feature, then the feature will match that exact
            wrapper method only and not the extra overloaded methods that SWIG generates.
            For example:

              %feature("except") hello(int i=0, double d=0.0);
              void hello(int i=0, double d=0.0);

           will apply the feature to all three wrapper methods, that is:

              void hello(int i, double d);
              void hello(int i);
              void hello();

           If the default arguments are not specified in the feature:

              %feature("except") hello(int i, double d);
              void hello(int i=0, double d=0.0);

           then the feature will only apply to this wrapper method:

              void hello(int i, double d);

           and not these wrapper methods:

              void hello(int i);
              void hello();

           This has been introduced to make %feature more powerful to ease the migration
           to new default arguments wrapping approach.

                      *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

           If you previously had a %feature and didn't specify the default arguments,
           you will have to add them in now or you can obtain the original behaviour
           by using %feature("compactdefaultargs").

11/04/2004: wsfulton
            [C#] Typemaps for std::vector added into std_vector.i. The proxy classes
            generated are modelled on the .NET ArrayList class. This isn't quite
            ready for general consumption yet, but will work with vectors of primitive
            types and some classes.

10/3/2004: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
            [GUILE] The -scm interface is now the default.  The old GH interface can
	    still be enabled by passing -gh to SWIG.

10/2/2004: mmatus

	    - More fixes for namespace + class declarations.
	      As an extra bonus, we get %template support for static/members class
	      methods, ie, now you can say:

	        namespace space {
                 struct A			    
	         {				    
	           template <class Y>	    
	           static void fooT(Y y) { }
	         };	
		}			    
	      	      			    
	        struct B			    
	        {				    
	          template <class Y>		    
	          void barT(Y y) {} 
	        };                           

		%template(foo) space::A::fooT<double>;
		%template(foo) space::A::fooT<int>;
		%template(foo) space::A::fooT<char>;
                                                                                
		%template(bar) B::barT<double>;
		%template(bar) B::barT<int>;
		%template(bar) B::barT<char>;

	      and call

	        A.foo(1)
		b = B()
		b.bar(1)
	      
	      note the methods are emitted inside the classes,
	      and hence, the %template name refers to the 'member'
	      method name, not a global namespace name.

10/31/2004: mmatus
	    - Solve namespace + class declarations, as in

	       namespace foo {
                 struct Bar;
		 struct Foo {
                 };
               }

               struct foo::Bar : Foo {
               };

	       see namespace_class.i for more examples.

            - Fix %template directive to properly use namespaces,
              including the case:

		   namespace one
		   {
		       template <typename T>
		       struct Ptr {};
                   }

		   namespace one
		   {		  
		       struct Obj1 {};
		       typedef Ptr<Obj1> Obj1_ptr;
  		       %template(Obj1_ptr) Ptr<Obj1>; 
		   }				  
		   				  
		   namespace two  
		   {
		       struct Obj2 {};	
		       typedef one::Ptr<Obj2> Obj2_ptr;
		       %template(Obj2_ptr) one::Ptr<Obj2>;
		   }

	      this is done by using the namespace name 'one' to create
              a namespace node to emit the template instantiation,
              just as before, but the template parameters are resolved
              and qualified in the current namespace ('one' or 'two').
              This is same way that typedef works. 

	      This resolve the smart_pointer_namespace2.i case, and at
              the same time, several other ones where before swig was
              generating the

	        "Can't instantiate template 'xx' inside namespace 'yy'"
	      
	      error message. In fact, that error doesn't exist
	      anymore. You can only get an error if you use a bad
	      namespace name or so.

	    - [ruby] Directors fixes:
	      - enums and std::strings are working now (several
	        reports in bug track system)
	      - added patch 1025861 for director + exceptions
		
              *** Attention ***: ruby with directors + protected
              members work with version 1.7+. Older versions seems to
              have a broken signature for'rb_protect'.
		
	      If you need to use an old version, look at

	      http://excruby.sourceforge.net/docs/html/ruby__hacks_8hpp-source.html
  	      for workarounds.
	      
            - [ruby] Fix memory allocation problem in typemap (bug 1037259)

	    - [tcl] Fix (enums|constants) + namespace option 
	            (reported by jason.m.surprise@intel.com).

            - [perl] Add patch 962168 for multiple inheretance
	    
	    - Fix 'defined' as variable name.

10/29/2004: wsfulton
            Seg fault fix for global scope operator used for friend methods:

              class B {
                friend void ::globalscope();
                ...
              };

10/28/2004:mmatus
	    - Added module and swig option "templatereduce" to force swig
	      to reduce any type needed with templates, ie, in these cases

                %module("templatereduce") test

                template <class T> struct A { };

                typedef int Int;
	        %template(A_Int) A<Int>  ==>  %template(A_Int) A<int>

                typedef B* Bp;
	        %template(A_Bp) A<Bp>  ==>  %template(A_Bp) A<B*>

              swig reduces the types Int and Bp to their primitives
              int and B*. This is closer to the usual compiler
              resolution mechanism, and it is really needed sometimes
              when you mix templates + typedefs + specializations.

	      Don't use it if you don't have any problem already,
	      since the type reduction can interfere with some
	      user typemaps, specially if you defined something like

		   typedef int Int;
		   %typemap(in) Int ...;

              in this case, when you use the "templatereduce" option,
	      swig will ignore the user typemap, since the "typedef int Int"
	      will take precedence, and the usual "int" typemap will be
	      applied. 

	      Note that the previous case is not common, and should be
	      avoided, ie, is not recommended to use a typedef and a
	      typemap at the same time, specially if you are going to
	      use templates + specializations.

	    - Directors:

	        virtual destructor is always emitted now, this doesn't
	        cause any harm, and could solve some nasty and
	        mysterious errors, like the one mentioned by Scott.

		also the destructor is not in-lined, so, that can solve
		some other mysterious errors when mixing directors +
		imports + embedded applications + some specific compilers.
		
10/27/2004: wsfulton
            [C#] typemaps.i library file with INPUT, OUTPUT and INOUT typemaps added.

10/27/2004: wsfulton
            [Java] std::wstring typemap fixes in std_string.i from Russell Keith-Magee.

10/25/2004: mmatus 

	    - Using + namespace is working now (using_namespace.i).

	    - Derived + nested classes is working now
	      (deriver_nested.i), but of course, we are still waiting
	      for the nested class support.
	    
	    - Directors:
	      - unnamed parameters support,

	      - protected constructor support (automatic and with
                dirprot mode),

	      - detection of really needed protected declarations
                (members and constructors) now is done automatically.
                Even if you don't use the 'dirprot' mode, swig will
                wrap what is minimally needed (and protected) for the
                code to compile.
		
		what is public, as usual, is always wrapped, and if
		you use the 'dirport'
		

	    - Final fixes for the OSS to compile with SWIG 1.3.23 (my
	      very very ugly C++ + templates + everything mounters wrap).

10/25/2004: wsfulton
            [C#] New commandline option -dllimport. This enables one to specify
            the name of the DLL for the DllImport attribute. Normally this name
            comes from the module name, so now it is possible to override this:

              swig -csharp -dllimport xyz example.i

            will generate for all the wrapped PInvoke methods:

              [DllImport("xyz", EntryPoint="...")]
              public static extern ...

            The wrappers from many different SWIG invocations can thus be compiled
            into one DLL.

            A new special variable $dllimport can also be used in typemaps, pragmas,
            features etc. This will get translated into the value specified by -dllimport
            if specified, otherwise the module name.

10/22/2004: wsfulton
            [Java] Patch #1049496 from Scott Michel fixes directors methods with 
            enums when wrapped with typesafe or proper Java enums.

10/21/2004: wsfulton
            Fixes for default arguments in director constructors (Python, Ruby, Ocaml).

10/21/2004: mmatus
	    - [Python] Add the '-cpluscast' option to enable the 'new'
	      C++ casting operators, such as 'static_cast', inside the
	      typemaps. By default swig use the old C cast style, even
	      when parsing C++.
	      
	    - [Python] Add the '-new_vwm' option to enable the new
              SwigValueWrapper mode. Now this is mainly for testing
              that the typemaps are really safe for any future
              solution, but you can use it if you have a very strange
              error with default cosntructors missing + %apply +
              %typemap, and if everything else fails (see
              valuwrapper_opaque.i for alternative and current
              solutions). If you are a user that don't know what is
              SwigValueWrapper, don't even try it.

	    - [Python] Add the '-noh' option to be used with directors
	      and when you prefer to disable the generation of the
	      director header file. If not used, swig will work as
	      usual generating both the wrap.cxx and wrap.h files. If
	      you use it, swig will only generate wrap.cxx.

10/21/2004: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
            - If you define SWIG_TYPE_TABLE when compiling a wrapper file,
	      the runtime types will be stored in the given type table name.
	      Using this, you can seperate different modules to share their
	      own type systems.  -DSWIG_TYPE_TABLE=Mytable

	    - [Python] If you define SWIG_STATIC_RUNTIME then the type information
	      will be static to this wrapper.  Nothing will be shared with any
	      other modules

	    - [Python] If you define SWIG_LINK_RUNTIME, then instead of using
	      the new way of sharing type information, the wrapper will expect
	      to be linked against the Lib/linkruntime.c file.  Any modules compiled
	      with SWIG_LINK_RUNTIME and linked against linkruntime.c will all
	      share type information.

10/20/2004: mmatus
	    - [Python] Initial fix for python/import example. Please
	      update the Makefile (autoconf, configure, etc, expert),
	      since now probably is only working with g++, icc and a
	      few other compilers that have the -shared option.

	      We need to create additional shared libraries for the
	      virtual destructors. Old and usually forgotten C++
	      requirement.
	      
	      Same fix need to be used in perl, I think.

            - [Python] Fix generation of header file for directors,
              now directors.swg is also included, so, it can be really
	      used from C++, and it solves some problem with compiler
	      that require that, even with the simple swig inclusion.  

            - [Python] Reordering the methods and moving some bodies
              outside the class declaration. This is needed due to
              some gcc-2.96 internal compiler errors. It seems the
              PYTHON class is getting too large to been declared and
              defined at the same time.

	    - Add the -oh option to change the output header file name
              if needed:

                 swig -c++ -python test.i -o test.CC -oh test.HH
	      
              this is mainly needed when using directors, and if the
              current default header file name is not good for you,
              which is generated as follow:	      

                 swig -c++ -python test.i             => test_wrap.h
                 swig -c++ -python test.i -o test.CC  => test.h

            1) Compact default arguments feature added. This feature allows one
              to use the default argument code generation that was used in
              SWIG-1.3.22 and earlier versions. It produces more compact wrappers
              as only one wrapper method is generated for any method with default
              arguments. So the advantage is it generates less code but has the
              original limitations, like it it does not work with all default arguments
              and default arguments cannot be taken advantage of in the strongly typed
              languages (C# and Java). It is implemented via the usual %feature mechanism:

                %feature("compactdefaultargs");

            2) Keyword arguments (kwargs) are working again for default arguments
               in the languages that support it, ie, Python and Ruby. The new default
               argument wrapping approach using overloaded methods cannot support kwargs
               so the compact default argument feature is automatically turned on when
               kwargs are specified, by %feature("kwargs").

            3) Compact default arguments are also automatically turned on when wrapping
               C (not C++) code. This is to support the bizarre notion of default arguments
               for C code.

10/20/2004: wsfulton
            Overloaded templated functions in namespaces also working now.
            Templated functions with default arguments in namespaces too.

10/19/2004: mmatus

	    - Allow to disable the new SwigValueWrapper mechanism,
	      if you add the following line in your language main.

		 /* Turn on safe value wrapper use mode */
                 Swig_value_wrapper_mode(1);

	      
	      Now is only active in python. All the other languages
	      are using the old resolution, but they  can also use the
	      "valuewrapper"/"novaluewrapper" features to fix some
	      of the old broken cases. Note, however,  that not all 
	      the broken cases can be solved in that way.

	      The new mechanism seems to be working fine in perl, ruby
	      and tcl, but failing in some typemaps in java.

	      Hence, is upto the language maintainer to test it, and
	      decide to enable it or not.

	      Look at the valuewrapper_opaque.i for examples.

	    - Fix more SwigValueWrapper cases when the new mechanism
	      is active. Now it also check for local typemap
	      variables, see valuewrapper_opaque.i for an example when
	      this is needed. But again, this extra checking will only
	      be activated when using the new value wrapper mode.

	    - [Python] Fix variable wrapping of classes with private
	      assign operators. It should be easy to fix in all the 
	      other modules, instead of checking

	         if (!Getattr(n,"immutable")) ...
	
	      you need to verify

	         if (is_assignable(n)) ...

	      Look at the private_assign.i for an example.

10/18/2004: mmatus
	    - %features "director"/"nodirector" now work as expected.
            - General fixes in %feature to resolve function decl
	      properly,
	      
	        %feature("hello") foo();
	        char foo() ->  f()    // was working
	        char *foo() -> f().p  // it wasn't
 

            - Template + specialization + default template args now is
	      working, (don't confuse with template + default arg
	      values, that was solved before), now this ugly case is
	      working:

	        template <class T, class A = Alloc<T> >
		struct Vector
		{
		   Vector(T a){}
		};		   

		template <>
		struct Vector<double>
		{
		  Vector(){}
		  int foo() { return 0; }
                };

	        %template(V_c) Vector<char, Alloc<char> >;
	        %template(V_i) Vector<int>;    // picks Vector<int,Alloc<int> >
	        %template(V_d) Vector<double>; // picks the specialization
	      
              this is needed for automatic STL support (later will
              be).

	    - Fix the template + typedef errors in test-suite, which
              probably will fix another group of strange template +
              namespaces + typedefs errors.

	    - %warnfilter is working better now, parser.y tries to use
	      them when needed.

	    - **** New default type resolution method (stype.c) ***** 

	      It preserves the original mixed types, then it goes
	      'backward' first deleting the qualifier, then the inner
	      types, for example:
    		 							  
    		 typedef A *Aptr;				  
    		 const Aptr&;						
    		 r.q(const).Aptr       -> r.q(const).p.SWIGTYPE		
    		 r.q(const).p.SWIGTYPE -> r.p.SWIGTYPE			
    		 r.p.SWIGTYPE          -> r.SWIGTYPE			
    		 r.SWIGTYPE            -> SWIGTYPE			
		 							
    		 enum Hello {};						
    		 const Hello& hi;					
    		 r.q(const).Hello          -> r.q(const).enum SWIGTYPE	
    		 r.q(const).enum SWIGTYPE  -> r.enum SWIGTYPE		
    		 r.enum SWIGTYPE           -> r.SWIGTYPE		
    		 r.SWIGTYPE                -> SWIGTYPE			
		 							
    		 int a[2][4];						
    		 a(2).a(4).int           -> a(ANY).a(ANY).SWIGTYPE	
    		 a(ANY).a(ANY).SWIGTYPE  -> a(ANY).a().SWIGTYPE		
    		 a(ANY).a().SWIGTYPE     -> a(ANY).p.SWIGTYPE		
    		 a(ANY).p.SWIGTYPE       -> a(ANY).SWIGTYPE		
    		 a(ANY).SWIGTYPE         -> a().SWIGTYPE		
    		 a().SWIGTYPE            -> p.SWIGTYPE			
    		 p.SWIGTYPE              -> SWIGTYPE                    

	      before it always stops after finding ref/pointer/enum/array/etc.
	       
	      Now, then, you can define (use and apply) 'higher' typemaps such as:

                %typemap(in) SWIGTYPE* const&  
	        %typemap(out) char FIXSIZE[ANY]
                %typemap(in) SWIGTYPE* const&  
	        %typemap(in) const enum SWIGTYPE&
	        %typemap(in) SWIGTYPE[ANY][ANY]
	        %typemap(in) const char (&)[ANY]
	       
	      It is possible with this change that previous typemaps
	      that were defined (but ignored), now will start to work.

	      Also, it is necessary check for the '%typemap(varin) SWIGTYPE[]',
	      before it was usually not defined (but char[] was),
	      and that can produce some inconsistencies.

                      *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	      This change was needed for STL, since std::vector<enum Hello> 
	      std::vector<A*>, etc, will always generate methods that
	      mix const references with the vector type.

	      Now that is working, all the std::container<T*>
	      specialization will not be needed anymore, well, in
	      theory. 

	      In the practice, everythin is working as before until
	      the proper mixed types are defined and the libraries
	      simplified to use them.

	    - Change the behavior of extern "java"/"fortran"/"etc", 
	      now swig produces a warning, and use extern "C" instead.
	      The warning can also be disable with the "-w 313" flag.
	      (WARN_PARSE_UNDEFINED_EXTERN).

	    - SwigValueWrapper is now more selective (lang.cxx).

            [Perl/Tcl]
	    - Fix some typemaps (perl/tcl) to work properly with
	      SwigValueWrapper. This was not a problem with
	      SwigValueWrapper, but with the typemaps that now are
	      safe to use with %apply.

	    [Python]

            - Fix %callback/%pythoncallback work now as before after
	      the def args changes. Also, %callback now is an alias
	      for %pythoncallback, so, they do the same.

	    [Python/Ruby]
	    - %callback is more usable and uniform:

                 %callback("%s_cb") foo();  // for both, python/ruby
                 %callback("%s_cb");        // for both, python/ruby
                 %callback(1) foo();        // only in python.

	    [OCAML]
	    - Tweak to enum typing for soundness in the presence of multiple
	      modules.
	    - global functions are now unambiguous in multiple loaded modules.
	    - Fixed test case code to build multimodule test cases correctly.
	    - There is no way to share overload resolution across modules
	      because of soundness issues.  If the user wants to call some
	      function foo from an arbitrary module bar, they will have to
	      use Bar._foo to call it correctly.  Later I will fix the 
	      camlp4 module to do something clever in this case.  
            - Promided performance overhaul of class mechanism.
	    - Removed symbol hack for ocaml-3.07 and below which is not needed
	      for ocaml-3.08 and above.

10/16/2004: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
            [CHICKEN]
	    - Completly change how chicken.cxx handles CLOS and generic code.
	      chicken no longer exports -clos.scm and -generic.scm.  The clos
	      code is exported directly into the module.scm file if -proxy is passed.
	    - The code now always exports a unit.  Running the test-suite is now
	      majorly broken, and needs to be fixed.
	    - CLOS now generates virtual slots for member variables similar to how
	      GOOPS support works in the guile module.
	    - chicken no longer prefixes symbols by the module name, and no longer
	      forces all names to lower case.  It now has -useclassprefix and -closprefix
	      similar to how guile handles GOOPS names.

10/16/2004: wsfulton
            Templated functions with default arguments working with new default argument
            wrapping approach. The new approach no longer fails with the following default
            argument pattern (previously failed with some primitive types, like 
            unsigned primitive types):

              template<typename T> int foo(const T& u = T());
              %template(foo) foo<unsigned int>;

            This relies on the templated function overloading support just added, so all
            the combinations of overloading by template parameters and normal parameters
            as well as overloading with default parameters works.

10/16/2004: wsfulton
            Added support for the large range of templated function overloading that C++
            supports.

            - Overloaded templated functions, eg

              template<typename T> int overload(T t);
              template<typename T> int overload(T t, const T &r);

            - Fixes where the templated type is not used in the parameter list, eg

              template<typename T> void xyz();
              template<> void xyz<double>();

            - Fixes for overloading of plain functions by a templated function:

              void abc(double d);
              template<typename T> void abc(T t);

            - Overloading by templated parameters fixed:

              template<typename T> void foo(T t) {}
              template<typename T, typename U> void foo(T t, U u) {}

              %template(foo) foo<double, double>;

            - All combinations of the above also working including specializations, eg:

              void abc(double d);
              template<typename T> void abc(T t);
              template<> void abc<double>(double t);
              template<> void abc(int t);

10/16/2004: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
            - Remove the ability to share type information by using c linking.
              All type sharing happens through a global variable in the target language.
                + Remove SWIG_NOIMPORT, SWIG_RUNTIME, and related defines.
                + Deprecate -runtime, -noruntime command line options
                + Update test-suite common.mk to correctly build multicpptest
                + Remove reference to precommon.swg
                + Update the guile_gh interface to share data by a global var instead
                  of c linkage.

            - Remove Advanced.html, since everything in it is now obsolete

10/09/2004: mmatus
	    - Split the python std/STL C++ library files, now
	      all the language independent definitions are under
	      the directory
	      
		Lib/std

	      and hence, can be used from other languages.

	    - Add more documentation to the Python STL, and
	      clean unnecessary code.

	    - Add initial C99 complex support, and some fixes
	      for long double.

10/08/2004: mmatus
	    - Fix the SwigValueWrapper for opaque types, now it is 
	      applied for opaque templates and classes, for which we
	      don't know if there is or not a default constructor, ie

                 struct A { 
                   A(int);
                 };
 
              Still, if you know that you class has a default
              constructor, and for some very very particular reason
              you want to avoid the SwigValueWrapper, and you don't
              want or can't expose the class to swig, now you can
              say

                 %feature("novaluewrapper") A;    
                 class A;
               
              or the other way around, if the class has a default
              constructor, but you want to use the value wrapper, you
              can say

                 %feature("valuewrapper") A;
                 struct A { 
                   A();
		   ....
                 };   
      
	    - Fix for char > 128, ie

                const char tilde_a = '\341';

            - Add patch 1041858 for $lextype, which carries the 
              literal type of a symbol. See lextype.i in the
              test-suite for more details.

	    {Ruby, Java] Fix director + 'empty' throws

		    struct A {
		      A() throw();
		      virtual ~A() throw();
		      int foo() throw();
		    };


10/06/2004: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
            [TCL]
            - Fix bug reported by William A. Hoffman propagating clientdata
            between modules.  Added clientdata_prop.multicpptest to check for
            this bug.  The fix involved the following changes:
                + SwigType_clientdata_collect does not need to check
                types in r_resolved because we only want to propagate clientdata
                to typedefed classes, and r_mangled already takes care of typedefs.

                + SWIG_TypeRegister now copies the clientdata field correctly

                + Move SWIG_Guile_PropagateClientData function from guile module
                into common.swg, because we need to call it from both guile and tcl.

                + Add base_names to swig_class to delay the lookup of bases.  SWIG
                now exports the base names and only when the base swig_class is
                needed is SWIG_TypeQuery(name)->clientdata looked up.

            - conversion_ns_template testsuite test was failing because
            the name of the wrapped constructor function was not calculated
            correctly for structs.  Fixed.

10/06/2004: wsfulton
            Fixes for default arguments used in directors - in virtual
            methods and director constructors.

10/06/2004: mmatus
	    Fix the __cplusplus macro, and bug 1041170.
	    Now it is working as supposed, ie, you can safely use

	      #ifdef __cplusplus
	      ...
	    
	    all over swig, including inside %defines and %{ %} bodies.

	    
                      *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	    The old trick of using

	      #if __cplusplus

	    doesn't work any more. So, if you have your own typemaps
	    using that syntax, you will need to migrate them to use
	    "#ifdef __cplusplus".

10/05/2004: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
            - Reorganize how runtime type information is stored and shared
	    between modules.  For chicken and mzscheme, I removed
	    the ability to use runtime libraries, while perl, tcl, python, and
	    ruby default to using the new method but can go back to the old
	    method by declaring SWIG_ALLOW_RUNTIME.

	    - line 582 in mzscheme.cxx was generating a segfault on 
	    imports.multicpptest, so I fixed it.

10/05/2004: wsfulton
            Fixes for %extend and overloaded static methods with default
            arguments.

10/05/2004: mmatus
	    - [python] Fix director + method with 'empty' throw, ie

		    struct A {
		      virtual int foo() throw();
		    };
		    
	      other languages should also easy to fix, look for
	      Getattr(n,"throw") in python.cxx.

	    - Fix director + destructor with 'empty' throw

		    struct A {
		      virtual ~A() throw();
		    };

	    - Now SWIG_FEATURES parse all and the same  options you
              can pass to swig in the command line.
	      
	    - New command line flag: -features <list>, as in

	        swig -features autodoc=3,director

	      ie, any global feature can be initialized from the
	      command line. This is mainly for testing, but users
	      can also take advantage of it.

10/04/2004: mmatus
	    - Properly qualify type in syntax as 'long(2)' or 'Foo()',
	      this solve old problem with default args, and probably
	      other problems around. However, the default arg problem
	      was also already solved by William (see bellow).

	    - Fix feature_set and feature_get methods. Before
	      they look from particular to general and keep the first
	      feature found. This didn't work well with templates.
	      Now the methods look from general to particular, and
	      override any found feature.

            - Previously a feature could not be applied to constructors
              or destructors that weren't explicitly declared in the class.
              This is now fixed, for example:

                %feature("featurename") Foo() "..."
                %feature("featurename") ~Foo() "..."
                class Foo {
                  // implicit Foo() and ~Foo()
                };

	    - Fix missing features for default const/dest, by really
	      'creating' the methods and applying the features.

	    - Fix return_const_value.i case by adding SwigValueWrapper<const T>
	      specialization.

	    - Fix %extend + overload, including overloading actual
              class methods. 

	    - Adding more cases in related files in the test-suite.  

10/04/2004: wsfulton
            Changes to the way default arguments are wrapped. Previously a single
            method was generated for each method that had default arguments. If
            a method had 5 arguments, say, of which 1 had a default argument
            then the call to the wrapped method would pass 5 arguments. The default
            value was copied into the wrapper method and used if the scripting
            language passed just 4 arguments. However, this was flawed as the
            default argument sometimes does not have global access, for example
            SWIG would generate code that couldn't compile when wrapping:

              class Tricky {
              public:
                void foo(int val = privatevalue);
                void bar(int val = Tricky::getDefault());
              private:
                static int getDefault();
                enum { privatevalue = 200 };
              };

            Also bugs in resolving symbols generated code that wouldn't compile, for example
            (probably fixable though):

              namespace Space {
                class Klass {
                };
                Klass constructorcall(const Klass& k = Klass());
              }

            The approach also does not work for statically typed languages (C# and Java)
            as these languages do not allow methods to have variable number of arguments.
            Although C# has a mechanism to pass a variable number of arguments they
            must be of the same type and are more like varargs.

            The new approach solves the above problems and wraps methods with default
            arguments as if the method was overloaded. So SWIG will now treat

              void foo(int val=0);

            as if it had parsed:

              void foo(int);
              void foo();

            The code generated is then exactly the same as if SWIG had parsed the two
            overloaded methods. The scripting languages count the arguments passed and call
            the appropriate method, just like overloaded methods. C# and Java are now able
            to properly wrap methods with default arguments by generating extra methods,
            again as if the method was overloaded, so for:

              void bar(string s="hello", double d=10.0, int i=0);

            the following proxy methods are generated:

              void bar(string s, double d, int i);
              void bar(string s, double d);
              void bar(string s);
              void bar();

            The new approach comes with a couple of minor knock on effects.

            1) SWIG support for default arguments for C (not C++) code no longer works.
            Previously you could have this interface:

              %{
              void foo(int val);
              %}
              void foo(int val=0);

            and call the wrapped method from a scripting language and pass no arguments
            whereupon the default of 0 was used. You can get the same behaviour for C
            code by using the "default" typemap:

              %typemap(default) int val "$1 = 0;";
              %{
              void foo(int val);
              %}
              void foo(int val);

            or you could of course compile your code as C++ if you want C++ features :) :

              %{
              void foo(int val=0);
              %}
              void foo(int val=0);

            A couple of SWIG's libraries used this C extension and these have been modified
            to use the "default" typemap. The "default" typemap is thus unchanged (and still
            is not and is not fully supported by C# and Java, and is likely to remain so).


            2) All features (%feature, %rename, %ignore etc) no longer work as if the method
            with default arguments is just one method. For example, previously

              %ignore foo(int);

            would have ignored the method completely. Now it will only ignore foo(int) but
            not the extra foo() method. Instead use:

              %ignore foo;

            to ignore them all. or

              %ignore foo(int);
              %ignore foo();

            This of course allows one to fine tune the wrapping, for example one could use:

              %rename(fooint) foo(int);
              %rename(foodefaults) foo();
              void foo(int val=0);

            and call them from any language like so:

              fooint(200)
              foodefaults()

            or for example ignore the extra overloaded method, so the defaults cannot be used:

              %ignore foo();
              void foo(int val=0);

	   [Python]
	   - More cleaning up and uniformation on the Python Lib

	   - Added Robin's docstring patch, plus some fixes, plus
	     some extensions, see autodoc.i example in the test-suite,
	     and try using %feature("autodoc","extended").
	    
	     This patch is not a complete solution for the
	     documentation problem, just enough to inform python about
	     the parameter list.

	     The expected swig documentation support is far far away yet.
	     

10/1/2004: mmatus
	   - Fix the %callback feature (only used in ruby and python examples,
	     by now, but it should be generic), now member callbacks
	     are working again
	     
	   - Fix wrapping of functions pointers like

		 std::ostream& std::endl(std::ostream&);

	     ie, the ones that return references or enums.
	 
	   [Python] Add the %pythoncallback directive, which is 
	   an improved version of %callback, ie,

	     %pythoncallback(1) foo;
	     %pythoncallback(1) A::bar;
	     %pythoncallback(1) A::barm;

	     int foo(int a) {
	         return a;
	     }
  
	     struct A 
	     {
	       static int bar(int a);
	       int barm(int a);

	     };

             int foobar(int a, int (*pf)(int a));

	   in python you can use

             foo(2)
	     foobar(2,foo)
             A.bar(2)
	     foobar(2,A.bar)
          
           ie, no additional pointer elements are created, and
	   the original 'foo' and 'A.bar' can be used as parameters.

	   In the case of member fucntion however, still you need
	   to use the special variable Class::<fnc_name>_cb_ptr, ie:

 	     foobarm(3, a, A.barm_cb_ptr)
	   
	   we will try to fix this situation also, but later.  

	   [Python] Add more elements from the STL library, now
	   you can use

	     import std
	     std.cout << "hello " << 123 << std.endl

	   [Python] Fix in/out return mechanism, now swig will behave
	   as 1.3.21 but using a python list when needed. The problem
	   is that the types std::pair,std::vector,etc, use tuples,
	   and they interfer with the previous inout tuple type.

	   By using lists we solve the conflicts, swig acts as before,
	   but returns a list when more than one parameter are using
	   the OUT typemap. See the new inout.i example in the
	   test-suite.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR PYTHON MODULE ***
		   
           [Python] Much better error messages for bad arguments, now
	   you always get the argument number where the error occurred.

09/27/2004: wsfulton
            Patch from Bill Clarke -
            1) Warning emitted when -importall and -includeall is used together,
               with -includeall taking precedence.
            2) Ensure SWIGIMPORTED is always defined when a file is being
               imported with %import. Note that this is not the same as SWIGIMPORT,
               which gets defined in all generated wrapper files.

09/26/2004: mmatus

	    - add %feature("exceptionclass") to identify a class used
	      as exception. Before swig identified and marked a class
	      using the "cplus:exceptionclass" attribute. However, the
	      class needed to appear on an throw() statement.  Now
	      swig keeps trying to identify the exception classes, as
	      before, but it also allows the user to mark a class by
	      using the %feature explicitly. (mostly relevant for
	      python and chicken)

	    [Python]

	    - fix -modern option + exceptions, which mix old class
	      style with the new one. So, we always need to emit
	      the "nonmodern" python code.

	    - add the "python:nondynamic" feature and its handler

	      now if you have
	      
	      %pythonnondynamic A;
	      
	      struct A {
	       int a;
	       int b;
	      };

	      then, in the python side
	      
	      aa = A()
	      
	      aa.a = 1 # ok
	      aa.b = 2 # ok
	      aa.c = 3 # error, the class can not be extended dynamically.

	    
	    Since this is a feature, you can use

	      %pythonnondynamic;

            or 

	      %pythondynamic; [ Note: %pythondynamic since deprecated ]
   
	    to force all the wrapped classes to be "nondynamic" ones.

	    The default, as in regular python, is that all the wrapped
	    classes are dynamics. So, careful with your spelling.

09/14/2004: mmatus 
	    - Support the -I- option.

	    - Differentiate between %include <file> and %include "file".
	      This fix several corner cases.

	    
	    [Python] Several patches:

	    - Normalize the Lib file names: 
		*.swg internal files, 
		*.i   user files.

	    - Fix Char[ANY] typemaps, so they also delete any extra '\0' chars,
	      now they behave as before (1.3.21). Still, you can use
	      the SWIG_PRESERVE_CARRAY_SIZE macro if you need to
	      preserve the original size (see pystrbase.swg).

	    - Add the Char FIXSIZE[ANY] typemaps, to preserve the
              original C array sizes (see above). Though, you can't
              use them yet since %apply and arrays are not working
              together.

            - Add pyfragments.swg, now the user can add fragments
	      to override the default ones.

            [Perl] Applied patch #1019669 from Christoph Flamm. Adds support
            for %feature("shadow") in the same way as it works in Python. This
            enables one to override the generated shadow/proxy methods, including
            constructors and destructors. For example:

              /* Let's make the constructor of the class Square more verbose */

              %feature("shadow") Square(double w)
              %{
                sub new {
                  my $pkg = shift;
                  my $self = examplec::new_Square(@_);
                  print STDERR "Constructed an @{[ref($self)]}\n";
                  bless $self, $pkg if defined($self);
                }
              %}

              class Square {
              public:

	    [Python] Incompatibility reported by Bill Clarke (llib@computer.org):
	    
	    If you are using Sun Studio 8 (and possibly earlier
	    versions) to compile the output produced by swig
	    1.3.22rc1, and you are using C++ and STL templates then
	    you need to use either "-runtime" or "-noruntime".  If you
	    use neither of these options then you will probably get
	    compiler errors when trying to compile the wrapper file;
	    the error message will be like this: The name
	    SWIG_Python_ConvertPtr[...] is unusable in static
	    swigpy::traits_asptr[...]  If you get this error message,
	    you need to regenerate your wrapper file using 'swig
	    -runtime' or 'swig -noruntime'.

	    You shouldn't get this problem with Sun Studio 9.

            As discussed in bug #772453, the SWIG library directory is now installed
            into a different default directory. The library used to be installed to
            /usr/local/lib/swig1.3. It is now in the more usual architecture independent
            directory and I have additionally used a version specific subdirectory as
            the library will rarely work with older versions of SWIG. This release
            will thus use /usr/local/share/swig/1.3.22 by default, which can be
            tailored as before using './configure --swiglibdir'.

            Patch #864689 from Robin Dunn:

            This patch corrects two problems in the XML output of SWIG:
             
              1. There were often extra '/>\n' in the output.
              
              2. value attributes were output with '\n' in them but
              since that is not technically legal most (all?) XML
              parsers will strip them out. Replacing the '\n' with
              the '&#10;' entity reference solves this as that is
              legal and XML parsers will convert it to a '\n' when
              reading the values back in.
              
              This patch also adds a new global command line option
              that will allow the parse tree to be written out in XML
              *after* some other language module has been run, in
              order to be able to get extra info that the language
              module puts in the tree. In this way the XML is a
              post-processed version of the tree rather than a
              pre-processed version. 
 
              Command line option is -dump_xml or -xmlout <file>

07/08/2004: wsfulton
            The deprecated runtime library build has been removed. This also removes
            the dependency on Libtool. Libtool is no longer required to build SWIG.
            The associated -ldflags SWIG commandline option has also been removed.

            The examples and test-suite testcases that used the runtime library have
            been updated to use the replacement approach to using SWIG across 
            multiple modules, that is they use the -noruntime and -runtime commandline
            options, see Modules.html. Effectively they build their own runtime
            libraries using -runtime. The examples are import and import_template.
            The test cases are in the imports and template_typedef_import directories.

            Anyone who wants the original runtime libraries can either run the test-suite
            or build the examples and use the appropriate shared object/DLL that is
            generated with the -runtime commandline option. For example libimports_runtime.so
            (Python calls it lib_imports_runtime.so) is generated after running the 
            'make imports.multicpptest' testcase in the Examples/test-suite/<lang>
            directory. Or use libruntime.so / runtime.dll after building the import
            examples in Examples/<lang>/import.

            [Java] New feature for Java exceptions with format %javaexception(exceptionclasses).
            This feature is a slight enhancement to %exception and the only difference is the 
            addition of the exception classes which are generated into a throws clause.
            The 'exceptionclasses' is a comma separated list of classes which will be
            added to the associated proxy method's throws clause. The 'exceptionclasses'
            are specified like the exception classes in the 'throws' attribute in the
            typemaps. This feature should be used for correctly handling checked exceptions
            thrown from JNI code. For example:

              %javaexception("java.lang.Exception") throwException %{
                ... convert a std::logic_error into a java.lang.Exception using JNI code ...
              %}

              #include <stdexcept>
              void throwException() {
                throw std::logic_error("Logic error!");
              }

            will generate a method with a throws clause in the module class:

              public static void throwException() throws java.lang.Exception { ... }

            [C#] New %csconstvalue(value) feature directive for use with constants and
            enums. This works the same way as %javaconstvalue. For C#, this directive
            is the only way that one can fix wrapping of C/C++ enums with proper C#
            enums if the enum item's initialiser cannot compile as C# code. This is
            because Java enums can use a call into C code to initialise the enum item,
            whereas in C#, the enum value must be a compile time constant. That is,
            using %csconst(0) cannot be used in C# to initialise the C# enum item via
            a PINVOKE call.

06/27/2004: wsfulton
            [Java] New %javaconstvalue(value) feature directive for use with constants and
            enums. Sometimes the use of %javaconst(1) will produce code that won't compile
            under Java. If a compile time constant is required, %javaconst(0) is not an
            option. The %javaconstvalue directive achieves this goal and the value specified
            is generated as Java code to initialise the constant.  For example:

              %javaconst(1);
              %javaconstvalue(1000) BIG;
              %javaconstvalue("new java.math.BigInteger(\"2000\")") LARGE;
              %javaconstvalue(10) bar;
              %{
                const int bar = 10;
              %}
              %inline %{
                #define BIG 1000LL
                #define LARGE 2000ULL
                enum Foo { BAR = ::bar };
              %}

            Generates:

              public interface exampleConstants {
                public final static long BIG = 1000;
                public final static java.math.BigInteger LARGE = new java.math.BigInteger("2000");
              }
              public final class Foo {
                public final static Foo BAR = new Foo("BAR", 10);
                ...
              }

            Previously, none of BIG, LARGE or BAR would have produced compilable code
            when using %javaconst(1).

            %feature enhancements. Features can now take an unlimited number of attributes
            in addition to the feature name and feature value. The attributes are optional 
            and are much the same as the typemap attributes. For example, the following
            specifies two optional attributes, attrib1 and attrib2:

             %feature(featurename, attrib1="attribval1", attrib2="attribval2") name "val";
             %feature(featurename, val, attrib1="attribval1", attrib2="attribval2") name;

06/27/2004: wsfulton
            %feature improvements for the syntax that takes the feature value within the
            %feature() brackets. The value specified is no longer restricted to being just
            a string. It can be a string or a number. For example, this is now acceptable
            syntax:
              %feature("featurename",20.0);
            whereas previously it would have to have been:
              %feature("featurename","20.0");
            Useful for features that are implemented as a macro, for example:
              #define %somefeature(value)      %feature("somefeature",value)
            These will now work accepting either a string or a number:
              %somefeature("Fred");
              %somefeature(4);

            Patch to fix wrapping of templated methods. ISO compliant compilers, like
            Comeau and GCC-3.4.0, don't like the template specifier that SWIG was generating
            when calling the method. This fix may break some non standard compliant compilers,
            for example, Sun workshop compilers prior to version 6.2.p2. Patch submitted
            by Bill Clarke.

            [C#] Same as for Java below. The new typemaps are named differently, namely,

06/03/2004: wsfulton
            [Java] Typemap changes for the Java proxy / typewrapper and enum classes. A new
            typemap called javabody contains the essential support code for generation into the body
            of these classes. There is also a new javabody_derived typemap which is used instead for
            wrapped classes that have a wrapped base class. The code is basically, the getCPtr()
            method and swigCPtr and swigCMemOwn member variables. These used to be hard coded
            with no way to modify the code. The introduction of this typemap makes it possible for
            the user to tailor nearly every aspect of the code generation.
            The exception now is the code for director classes.

            The javagetcptr and javaptrconstructormodifiers typemaps are deprecated and are
            no longer used as the code that these generated can be put in the more flexible
            javabody and javabody_derived typemaps.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR JAVA MODULE ***

            The following macros contributed by Scott Michel may help you upgrade if you have used
            the javagetcptr typemap:

                /* Utility macro for manipulating the Java body code method attributes */
                %define SWIGJAVA_ATTRIBS(TYPENAME, CTOR_ATTRIB, GETCPTR_ATTRIB)
                %typemap(javabody) TYPENAME %{
                  private long swigCPtr;
                  protected boolean swigCMemOwn;

                  CTOR_ATTRIB $javaclassname(long cPtr, boolean cMemoryOwn) {
                    swigCMemOwn = cMemoryOwn;
                    swigCPtr = cPtr;
                  }

                  GETCPTR_ATTRIB static long getCPtr($javaclassname obj) {
                    return (obj == null) ? 0 : obj.swigCPtr;
                  }
                %}

                %typemap(javabody_derived) TYPENAME %{
                  private long swigCPtr;

                  CTOR_ATTRIB $javaclassname(long cPtr, boolean cMemoryOwn) {
                    super($moduleJNI.SWIG$javaclassnameUpcast(cPtr), cMemoryOwn);
                    swigCPtr = cPtr;
                  }

                  GETCPTR_ATTRIB static long getCPtr($javaclassname obj) {
                    return (obj == null) ? 0 : obj.swigCPtr;
                  }
                %}
                %enddef

                /* The default is protected getCPtr, protected constructor */
                SWIGJAVA_ATTRIBS(SWIGTYPE, protected, protected)

            [Java, C#] The contents of the class modifier typemaps and pragmas have changed.
            They must now include the class type. Previously 'class' was hard coded.
            This change enables flexibility into what type of class is generated,
            for example the proxy class could be an interface instead of a class.

            For Java this affects the javaclassmodifiers typemap and the jniclassclassmodifiers
            and moduleclassmodifiers pragmas.

            For C# this affects the csclassmodifiers typemap and the imclassclassmodifiers
            and moduleclassmodifiers pragmas.

            Unless you have overridden the default versions of these typemaps or pragmas, you
            shouldn't be affected. However, if you have, upgrading is easy, for example

                class Foo {};
                %typemap(javaclassmodifiers) Foo "public final"

            must now be:

                class Foo {};
                %typemap(javaclassmodifiers) Foo "public final class"

            Fix for C++ exception specifications that are references. Problem reported by
            Oren Miller. Also improves the generated exception declarations in the
            catch handler for pointers - a pointer is used instead of a reference to
            a pointer. Added default throws typemaps for SWIGTYPE &, SWIGTYPE * and

            [Java, C#] Some minor typesafe enum improvements, including storing the name of

	* Allegro CL module:  Now using some macros (defined in
	Lib/allegrocl/allegrocl.swg), swig-defconstant and swig-defun, for
	defining constants and foreign functions.  This makes the
	generated file a bit neater.    

	Now strips a layer of parenthesis from constants.

	Uses (* :void) instead of :foreign-address now.

05/20/2004: wsfulton
            Unnamed enum global variables are now supported in addition
            to the recently added support for unnamed enum member variables.
            For example:

                struct Foo {
                  enum { enum1, enum2 } MemberInstance;
                };
                enum { enum3, enum4 } GlobalInstance;

            The int typemaps are used for wrapping the get/set accessor methods.
            If the sizeof an enum is not the same size as an int then setting the
            variable will silently do nothing as the casts cannot be easily and portably
            generated. If you need to solve this highly obscure situation, write
            the assignment using the %exception feature.

            [C#] C# enum wrapping mods. Similar to the Java module, enums can be wrapped using
            one of 3 approaches:

            1) Proper C# enums - use %include "enums.swg"
            2) Typesafe enums - use %include "enumtypesafe.swg"
            3) Simple constant integers (original approach) - use %include "enumsimple.swg"

            See each of these files for further details. Each of these files use typemaps
            and a new feature to control the generated code. The feature is:

                %csenum(wrapapproach);

            where wrapapproach should be one of: "proper", "typesafe", "typeunsafe" or "simple".
            [No implementation deemed necessary for type unsafe enums].

            The default approach is proper C# enums. Anonymous enums are always wrapped by
            constant integers.

05/20/2004: wsfulton
            [Java] Java enum support added. There are now 4 ways in which enums can be wrapped:

            1) Proper Java enums - use %include "enums.swg"
            2) Typesafe enums - use %include "enumtypesafe.swg"
            3) Type unsafe enums (constant integers) - use %include "enumtypeunsafe.swg"
            4) Simple constant integers (original approach) - use %include "enumsimple.swg"

            See each of these files for further details. Each of these files use typemaps
            and a new feature to control the generated code. The feature is:

                %javaenum(wrapapproach);

            where wrapapproach should be one of: "proper", "typesafe", "typeunsafe" or "simple".
            The default typemaps will handle enums that may or may not have specified initial
            values, for example ten is specified:

                enum Numbers { zero, ten(10) };

            However, the amount of generated Java code can be cut down, by modifying these typemaps
            if none of the enums have initial values (proper Java enums and typesafe enums approach).
            
            The default approach is typesafe enums. Anonymous enums are always wrapped by
            constant integers.

	    [Guile] GOOPS proxy objects now also print the pointer
	    address of the C object.

05/14/2004: lyle
            Added Kou's patch for the Ruby %import directive so that modules
            with "nested" names are handled properly. Consider an interface
            file foo.i that has this %module declaration at its top:

                %module "misc::text::foo"

            Now consider another interface file spam.i that imports foo.i:

                %import foo.i
            
            Before this patch, this would result in the following code being
            generated for spam_wrap.c:

                rb_require("misc::text::foo");

            With this patch, however, you'll get the correct path name
            for the call to rb_require(), e.g.

                rb_require("misc/text/foo");

	    [Chicken] Fix bug 782468.
	    To fix this bug, the runtime code has been rewritten, and
	    pointers are now represented as a C_SWIG_POINTER_TYPE.

	    Chicken version > 1.40 is now required!

	    * Typemap incompatibility:  typemaps no longer use chicken_words.
	      If a typemap needs some space, it should just call C_alloc

	    * argout typemaps no longer use the /* if ONE */ construct to
	      build an output list.  A SWIG_APPEND_VALUE macro, exactly like
	      guile and mzscheme is now used.

04/25/2004: mkoeppe (Matthias Koeppe)
	    [Guile] In the generated GOOPS code, don't create methods

	    [Guile] In -gh mode, fix the "too many initializers" error
	    which was caused by an incompatible swig_type_info layout.

	    [Guile] The typemap for FILE * in ports.i now also accepts

	    don't set the "feature:nodirector" explicitly.

	    You can use this in your module if you want to use the
	    director feature in all your classes, but it is most
	    intended for testing purposes, like:

	      make check-python-test-suite SWIG="../../../swig  -directors"
	      make check-ruby-test-suite SWIG="../../../swig  -directors"
	      make check-java-test-suite SWIG="../../../../swig  -directors"

	    These commands will run the entire test-suite using
	    directors, and not only the specific 'directors_*'
	    cases. This should be done from time to time.

	    [python] Added support for std::wstring and wchar_t,
	    for compiler and python versions that support them.
	    
	    When needed, use 

	     %inlcude std_string.i      // 'char' strings
	     %inlcude std_wstring.i     // 'wchar_t' strings
	    

04/10/2004: mmatus (Marcelo Matus) 
	    
	    [python] Fix the default behaviour (seg. fault) when an
	    inplace operator (+=,-=,...) was wrapped, as reported by
	    Lucriz (lucriz@sitilandia.it), when the most common
	    form was used:

                   A&  A::operator+=(int i) { ...; return *this; }
                  ^^^^                                    ^^^^^^
	    

	    ie, an object is returned and its contains the same 'this'
	    value than the input object, which is deleted after the
	    operation "a += b", leaving the result with no real
	    object, but a seg. fault.

	    To fix it, we needed to introduce a new feature and use an
	    old one:

               %feature("self:disown") A::operator+=;
               %feature("new") A::operator+=;
	    
	    here, "self:disown" disable the ownership of the 'self'
	    or input object, and the "new" feature transfers the
	    ownership to the result object.
	    
	    The feature/solution could also be used in other languages
	    that use gc and implement the inplace operators, or other
	    operators, in a similar way.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR Python MODULE ***

	    If you already are using the inplace operators in python,
	    and you implemented some kind of workaround to the problem
	    fixed here, it is possible you could end with 'free'
	    objects that never get deleted. If that is the case, and
	    you want to disable the current fix, use:

               %feature("self:disown","") A::operator+=;
               %feature("new","") A::operator+=;

            [C#] C++ enums are no longer wrapped by integers, they are now wrapped by 
            C# enums. For Example, given C++:

                enum AnEnum { foo, bar };
                typedef AnEnum AnEnumeration;
                void something(AnEnum e, AnEnumeration f);

            The following is generated:

                public enum AnEnum {
                  foo,
                  bar
                }
                public static void something(AnEnum e, AnEnum f) {...}

            Note that a global enum like AnEnum above is generated into its own
            file called AnEnum.cs. Enums defined within a C++ class are defined
            within the C# proxy class. Some of the typemaps for modifying C# proxy
            classes also work for enums. For example global enums can use

                %typemap(csimports) to add in extra using statements.

            Global enums and class enums can use

                %typemap(csclassmodifiers) to make the enum private, public etc.
                %typemap(csbase) to change the underlying enum type (enum base)

            If we add this for the above example:

                %typemap(csclassmodifiers) AnEnum "protected"
                %typemap(csbase) AnEnum "long"

            the following is generated:
            
                protected enum AnEnum : long {
                  foo,
                  bar
                }

            Seg fault fix for empty enums, like
                enum Foo {};

03/21/2004: mmatus
            [Note: this change revoked on 04/25/2004]
	    [Python] Makes the following 'var' cases more uniform:

                std::string ga;
 
                struct A {
                  static std::string sa;
                  std::string ma;
                };


            now the three variables (ga, sa, ma) can be assigned as:


                  cvar.ga = "hello";
                  A.sa = "hello";
                  a.ma = "hello";

            ie, now 'ma' will also use a std::string typemap 'in' if
            defined, before it was only accepting a 'p_std_string'
            pointer.  Note, however, that 'ma' will not use the
            'varin/varout' typemaps (that probably could be more
            natural), but it will pick up the 'in' typemap for const
            std::string& (which is easier).

	    The changes in cwrap.c and lang.cxx will probably fix the
	    behaviour in other languages that do not overload the
	    membervarHandler method "too much".
 
            
03/21/2004: mmatus
	    [Python] Disabling the default instantiations like:

	      %template() std::pair<int,int>;

            for all the primitive types and STL containers/classes.
	    They are expensive, specially for pair and map, and the
	    previous behaviour also requires the user to perform
	    manual instantiations. Still, if the speed difference is
	    not important, it can be re-enabled by defining the macro
	    SWIG_STD_DEFAULT_INSTANTIATION (see std_common.i).

	    Also, normalizing the INPUT/OUTPUT/INOUT typemaps. Now
	    they use the same conversors than the rest of the
	    typemaps, and you can use them for std::pair, std::string
	    and all the other STL types, like in:

	      void p_inoutd(std::pair<double, double> *INOUT);

	    Added the attribute.i and implicit.i files with macros to
	    transform functions pairs like 'set_x'/'get_x' 
	    (or 'T& x()'/'const T& x() const') into an attribute,
	    and allowing the use of implicit constructors in typemaps
	    (see the files for more details).

03/21/2004: mkoeppe
	    [Guile] Fix the documentation strings of functions with
	    anonymous arguments.

03/18/2004: mmatus
	    [Python] More general std_string.i interface.
	    Now you can wrap it using

	      %template(string) std::basic_string<char>;

            and use the std::string as a base class:

	      struct A : std::string {
              };

	    But more important, swig will recognize 
	    both std::basic_string<char> and std::string as
	    the same type.

03/16/2004: mmatus
	    Previously added, but not mentioned before:

	    - friend declaration support, swig now emits a global
	      function in the same class scope.

	    - ref/unref features: to mix ref counting C++ classes
	      and native script ref counting mechanisms (like in python).
	    
	      Use it like:

 	        %feature("ref")   RCObj "$this->ref();"
                %feature("unref") RCObj "$this->unref();"

	      And the class RCObj, and all the derived ones, will
	      perform the right ref/unref calls when a new pointer  
	      is returned to the target language, or when the target
	      language attempts to delete the object.
	      
	      See the refcount.i file in the test-suite for more
	      details.

	    
03/16/2004: mmatus
	    [Python] Using the new %fragment support, major rewrote 
	    of the python swig library, including:

	    - Almost automatic template/typemap instantiation for
	      the STL components. For example, now you can write:

		   %template(vector_i) std::vector<int>;

              and a specialized vector_i class is emitted with all
	      the needed typemaps. No need to use the old
	      'specialize_vector' macros.

	      Note you can also define

	          %template(matrix_i)   std::vector<std::vector<int> >;
	          %template(vector_pii) std::vector<std::pair<int,int> >;

	    - The empty template instantiation 
 	 
           	  %template() std::vector<int>;

	      defines the vector typemaps, but no proxy class. For all the
              fundamental types, the empty template instantiation are
              defined, so, you can say

	      %include std_vector

	      int func(const std::vector<int>& a);
	      
	      where the proper typemap is applied to 'a', but no
	      std::vector<int> proxy is generated.
	      

            - All the STL containers present a more uniform behavior and
	      more complete interface declaration. The following are 
	      now supported:

		  std::vector<T>
		  std::list<T>
		  std::deque<T>
		  std::set<T>
		  std::multiset<T>
		  std::map<T>
		  std::multimap<T>
              
              not a container, but also supported:

		  std::pair<T,U>

              also, more typemaps are defined for all of them,
	      including varin, varout, typecheck, etc.

            - Initial attempt to implement the STL containers
              considering allocators, ie:

	          std::vector<T,A>			

	      it is partially working, but it is just a workaround
	      while swig improves its template type support.
	      
	      
	     Please test with your particular setup. It seems to be
	     working with g++ 3.2.2, g++ 2.96, Intel icc and SGI CC
	     compilers, plus python 1.5.2, 2.0 and 2.3, but since
	     we are using templates, there is a chance you can find
	     some problems when using with an old C++ compiler.

03/16/2004: mmatus

            - Allowing the empty %template directive, such as

                 %template() std::vector<int>;

	      to process the class "typedef"s and "typemap"s. Before
	      only the internal "typedef"s were processed.

              This makes possible to emit the default in/out
              typemaps without the need of wrapping an specialized
              vector instance.

	    - Adding the preprocessor extension #@ which mangles the
              following macro argument, like in:

                #define macro(X)  #@X
                macro(int)         -> int
                macro(std::string) -> std_s_s_string
                
	    - Fragments can now be "type specialized", as the typemaps. The
	      syntax is as follows
 
                %fragment("name","header") 
                  { /* a type independent fragment (old syntax) */ }
                %fragment("name" {Type}, "header") 
                  { /* the fragment is type dependent */}
 
              Now fragments can also be used inside templates: 

                template <class T>
                struct A {
                   %fragment("incode"{A<T>},"header") {
		      /* 'incode' specialized fragment */
		   }
 
		   %typemap(in,fragment="incode"{A<T>}) {
		      /*
		         here we use the 'type specialized' 
                         fragment "incode"{A<T>}
                      */
		    }
                };

            [Java, C#] Overloading changes:
              - Methods which are overloaded in const only no longer generate Java
                code that won't compile - the first method parsed is used and a
                warning is displayed. Note that this behaviour is slightly different
                to the scripting languages which always uses the non-const method.
              - Warning messages 509 and 512 replaced by new warning number 516, which 
                is more relevant to these statically typed languages as the overloaded
                methods aren't 'shadowed', they are ignored.

01/21/2004: sunshine (Eric Sunshine)
            Revived the NextStep port of SWIG.

            Fixed fatal problem in DohStrstr() caused by difference in strstr()
            implementation which made %apply become entirely dysfunctional.  On
            NextStep, strstr("foo","") evaluates to NULL; whereas, on modern
            platforms, it evaluates to "foo".  %apply relies extensively upon
            strstr("foo","") evaluating to non-NULL, therefore it failed
            catastrophically when faced with NextStep's strstr().

            Added `bool' check to configure.in since NextStep's C++ compiler
            does not supply this type.  swig.h now fakes up `bool' if needed.

            Worked around NextStep C++ compiler bug in which C++ code is
            disallowed inside extern "C" functions.  This problem affected all
            language modules, since they publish hook functions of the form:
                extern "C" Language *swig_foo(void) { return new FOO(); }
            Fixed by creating a C++ wrapper:
                static Language *new_swig_foo() { return new FOO(); }
                extern "C" Language *swig_foo(void) { return new_swig_foo(); }

            Ensured that Swig_copy_string() is used in place of strdup() since
            NextStep does not supply strdup().

            Fixed detection of Ruby library name and location in configure.in.
            Problem 1: Assumed that library always resided in Ruby's "archdir",
            which was correct for Ruby 1.6.x, but which is incorrect for Ruby
            1.8.x, in which case the library normally resides in Ruby's
            "libdir".  Problem 2: Assumed that the library could always be
            linked via "-l"+RUBY_INSTALL_NAME (where RUBY_INSTALL_NAME
            typically is "ruby"), however this failed for platforms, such as
            NextStep, which do not support shared libraries.  In this case, the
            static library name in 1.8.x is libruby-static.a, thus
            -lruby-static is required.  The new logic works correctly for
            static and shared libraries for 1.6.x and 1.8.x.

            Fixed detection of Perl CFLAGS in configure.in for NextStep.
            Detection code extracted CFLAGS from Perl's %Config hash but
            neglected to add a newline to the value before passing it through
            `sed'.  NextStep's ancient `sed' discards input which is not
            terminated with a newline, thus Perl CFLAGS always evaluated to the
            empty string.

01/16/2004: cheetah (William Fulton)
            Tidy up in the exception handling code that is generated when
            C++ exception specifications are wrapped with the throws typemap.
            This redundant code is no longer generated:

                catch(...) {
                    throw; 
                }

01/12/2004: wsfulton on behalf of mmatus (marcelo matus) 
            if a method uses %exception and the method requires the use
            of the throws typemap, the code in a throws typemap will be
            generated inside the try body. For example:

              %exception method {
                try {
                  // method action 
                  $action
                } catch (int i) {
                  // method int catch handler
                } catch (...) {
                  // method generic catch handler
                }
              }
              %typemap(throws) Except %{
                // throws typemap Except catch handler
              %}

              %inline %{
              class Except {};
              void method(int i) throw (Except);

            Will generate:

              {
                  try {
                      // method action 
                      try {
                          method(arg1);
                      }
                      catch(Except &_e) {
                          // throws typemap Except catch handler
                          
                      }
                      
                  } catch (int i) {
                      // method int catch handler
                  } catch (...) {
                      // method generic catch handler
                  }
              }


            As can be seen, the inner try catch block is for the throws typemaps.
            Previously, this was reversed so that the inner try catch block
            was the %exception code. In the example above, it would have been
            impossible to catch Except as the catch all (...) would catch the
            exception instead.

            The output format for both warnings and errors can be selected for
            integration with your favourite IDE/editor. Editors and IDEs can usually
            parse error messages and if in the appropriate format will easily take you 
            directly to the source of the error. The standard format is used by 
            default except on Windows where the Microsoft format is used by default.
            These can be overridden using command line options, for example:

                $ swig -python -Fstandard example.i
                example.i:4: Syntax error in input.
                $ swig -python -Fmicrosoft example.i
                example.i(4): Syntax error in input.

            Fixed [ 871909 ] simple namespace problem.
            This was a problem using anonymous structures in a namespace.
            For example:

                namespace ns {
                   typedef struct  {
                      int n;
                   } S;
                };

12/28/2003: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java and C#] Fixes for wrapping covariant (polymorphic) return types.
            For example:

                struct Base {
                  virtual ~Base();
                  virtual Base* copy() const = 0;
                };
                struct Derived : Base {
                  virtual Derived* copy() const;
                };

            The Derived::copy proxy method returns Base not Derived. A warning is issued
            about this. Previously the pointer used by the proxy class was incorrectly
            treated as a Base* instead of a Derived*.

12/18/2003: cheetah (William Fulton)
            Fix so that Windows paths are displayed correctly when reporting errors.
            An error previously would have been shown something like:

              .?xample.i:14: Syntax error in input.

            instead of:

              .\example.i:14: Syntax error in input.


Version 1.3.20 (December 17, 2003)
==================================

12/17/2003: beazley
            Last minute modifications.   Perl5 module now generates shadow classes
            by default like all of the other modules.  PHP4 wrappers no longer
            include "config.h". 

12/14/2003: beazley
            Weakened warning message related to constructor names so that an
            unusual nested-class wrapping technique would work again (apparently
            it worked in some older SWIG releases).   For example:

               class Scope {
                   class ClassA;
                   class ClassB;
               };
               class Scope::ClassA {
               ...
               };
               class Scope::ClassB {
               ...
               }

            Note:  There is still some odd interaction with the SWIG symbol
            table/type system that will need to be looked at in a future release.
            Reported by Gustavo Niemeyer.


12/11/2003: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Protected class methods are wrapped as protected Java methods 
            when using the dirprot director feature. This can be changed using
            %javamethodmodifiers to something else should the need arise, for
            example, private or package access.

12/11/2003: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java, C#] 
            %javamethodmodifiers (Java) and %csmethodmodifiers (C#) operate slightly 
            differently. Previously this feature had to be present to set the method
            modifiers. Now it is only used if it exists for the method being wrapped.
            The default is "public" as previous however, when wrapping protected
            director methods it is "protected". This change will not affect existing
            use of the %javamethodmodifiers or %csmethodmodifiers.

12/11/2003: mmatus (Marcelo Matus)

	    This fix some recurring reports about keywords not been
	    properly identified and warned, and it solves the problem
	    of how to add a test file to the test-suite such that it
	    doesn't use any keyword of all the supported languages
	    (and doing it without compiling the test for all the
	    supported languages, thing that is not always possible,
	    and without requiring you to know all the supported
	    language keywords, thing that is always impossible).

	    So these are the changes globally speaking:

	    - Uniform the definition of the keyword warnings through
	      the supported languages: all the languages has now a
	      separate file that defines the keywords or bad names:

		  python/pythonkw.swg
		  chicken/chickenkw.swg
                  ....

	    - Added keyword list for most of the languages that didn't
	      have one (using the new separated file).
		    	    
	    - Added the "All keywords" warning support: -Wallkw option.

              This option allows you to include all the known keywords
	      for all the supported languages, and can be used as:

                 swig -Wallkw ....
	    
	      This will help to the process of adding a test-suite
	      file that can be compiled in all the swig supported
	      languages, and it will be also helpful for users who
	      want to create multi-language libraries.
	    
	    And these are the detailed changes (mostly file addition):

	    - For the languages that already have some sort of keyword
	      warning list, move it to an external languagekw.swg
	      file, ie:
	    
	         move keywords from python.swg -> pythonkw.swg
	         move keywords from chicken.swg -> chickenkw.swg
	         move keywords from tcl8.swg -> tclkw.swg
 
              and re-include languagekw.swg from language.swg.
	    
	    - For the language that didn't have a keyword list, and
	      for the ones that I could find a list, add the
	      languagekw.swg file, ie:

                 csharp/csharpkw.swg
                 java/javakw.swg
                 php4/phpkw.swg
		 pike/pikekw.swg	 
		 ruby/rubykw.swg


              also add a line in language.swg to include
	      languagekw.swg, but now it is commented!!!, like in
	      java.swg:

                  /* java keywords */
                  /* please test and activate */
                  //%include "javakw.swg"

	      ie, there will be no change in how swig runs normally
	      until the language maintainer test and uncomment that
	      line.
	      
	      So, please check each languagekw.swg file (I left the
	      link to the keyword list source for checking), and after
	      testing, uncomment the %include line.

	    - Added the file allkw.swg, which includes all the
              languagekw.swg files.

	      For the languages that has no languagekw.swg file right
	      now, and if they need one, add the file into the
	      language directory, and add the corresponding include
	      line into the allkw.swg file.
	      
	    - Added the -Wallkw that includes the allkw.swg file.
	      Note that the old -lallkw.swg option couldn't be used
	      since it include the file after it would be needed.


	    Hopefully, the -Wallkw option will be added to the default
	    rules in the related test-suite Makefiles, so, when
	    creating a new test, or adding a new swig library file
	    (like _std_deque.i), swig will warn you if you are using a
	    bad name, considering all the language where it needs to
	    run.
	    
	    Right now you can test it by using:

               make check-python-test-suite SWIG="swig -Wallkw"

	    or using your favorite target language, it doesn't matter.

	    And yes, there are several examples that are using
	    reserved keywords, specially from csharp.
          
	    *** Remember ****: the new keyword warning lists are not
	    included by default in any of language that before didn't
	    have one. To enable the keyword warnings as the default
	    behavior, the inclusion of the languagekw.swg file has to
	    be uncommented at each language.swg file.

	    So, all the language maintainers, please check the
	    keywords list. 

	    Also, you can add buit-in names, and not only keywords, like
	    'True/False' in python.  Remember that you can be more
	    specific and refer only to member names, like *::configure
	    or *::cget (see an example in the tcl8/tcl8kw.swg file),
	    or only global names, like ::range (see an example in the
	    python/pythonkw.swg file.

	    Just to be consistent, use the following codes:

	    - Use code 314 for keyword and/or fatal bad names.
	    - Use code 321 for buit-in and/or not fatal bad names.
           
            so, they can't be disabled/enabled independently (see
	    python/pyhtonkw.swg for examples).

	    **** And don't add any new test file without checking it
	    with the -Wallkw option!! (that includes me) *****.

            SF bug #854634
            Added support for accepting the Unix directory separator '/' on 
            Windows and the Mac in addition to the native one ( '\' on 
            Windows). This can be used in %import, %include and commandline 
            options taking a path, for example -I. On Cygwin, both the Windows
            and Unix directory separator can now be used (was '/' only).
            
12/10/2003: mmatus (Marcelo Matus)

            [python] Implementing the runtime "reprotected" director
	    members, if you have:
    
                %feature("director") B;

                class Bar {
                public:
                  virtual ~Bar();
                  virtual int hello() { return do_hello();)

                protected:
                  virtual int do_hi() {return 0;}
                  virtual int do_hello() {return 0;}
                };

            then, at the python side

                import my_module

                class Foo(my_module.Bar):
                  def do_hello(self):
                    return 1
                  pass
                 
	        b = Bar() # Pure C++ Director class
                f = Foo() # C++ Director + python methods

                b.hello() # Ok, and it calls C++ Bar::do_hello()
                f.hello() # Ok, and it calls Python Foo::do_hello()

                b.do_hi() # RuntimeError, do_hi() is protected!!
                f.do_hi() # RuntimeError, do_hi() is protected!!
 
                b.do_hello() # RuntimeError, do_hello() is protected!!
                f.do_hello() # Ok, since it its redefined in python.

            Here Bar.do_hello is always protected, but Foo.do_hello
            is "public", because it is redefined in python. Before,
	    all the 'do_hello' methods were public.

	    This seems to be a good compromise between C++ and python
	    philosophies, ie, all the director protected methods keep
	    protected at the user side (C++ way) until they are
	    redefined (python way, were all defined methods are always
	    public). And this is not only a good compromise, it also
	    seems to be the only way to do it :).

	    Now ruby has native director protected members, and python
	    pure runtime support. I guess these are the two possible
	    extreme cases. And hopefully, they could be used as
	    templates to modify the other languages that support
	    directors, so they can "reprotect" the protected director
	    members at the target language side.

	    This finished the director protected support for the 
	    python language. Ocalm will need to add the
	    "reprotection" later.

12/10/2003: mmatus (Marcelo Matus)

	    The following case (reported by Lyle Johnson) was fixed:

	      %rename(x) Foo::y();
 
	      class Foo { 
	      public:
	        void y();

	      protected:
	        int x;
	      };

	   swig warned that the symbol 'x' was already defined, and
           the renaming fails. 'x' was not emitted, since it is
           protected, but it was kept in the symbol table with too
           much information.

	   Now swig works for all the cases (plain, director and
	   dirprot) again. This was fixed by allowing the parser.y to
	   decide much closer what to do with 'x'. Before all the
	   discarding or generation was resolved at the lang.cxx
	   stage. Also the changes in parser.y to implement the
	   director protected mode are now much more encapsulated, and
	   they get disabled if the mode is not enabled. Before the
	   deactivation was done at the generation stage (lang.cxx).

	   By the other hand, if the director mode is enabled, and
	   %rename is done, reusing a protected member name, there is
	   a pathological case:

	     %rename(x) Foo::y();
 
             class Foo : public A {
	     public:
	       void y();

	     protected:
	       int x;            /* works */
	       static  int x;    /* works */
	       static  void x(); /* works */
	       typedef void x(); /* works */

	       virtual void x(); /* always fails, as it should, since
                                    Foo::x() will be emitted in the
                                    director */

	       void x(); /* always fails, but sometimes it shouldn't,
                            since the Foo::x() will not be emitted if
                            it is not virtual */

	     };

	   The last case is not always right because at the parser.py
	   stage it is not possible to decide if the protected member
	   Foo::x() could or not conflict with the renamed Foo::y(),
	   since Foo::x() could be virtual by inheritance.

	   I guess this just an intrinsic limitation, and no much can
	   be done about it without resorting into larger changes to
	   postpone, under certain conditions, the multiply symbol
	   detection (lang.cxx stage).
	   
	   So, by now, it is just considered a well known "feature" in
	   the director protected mode. The good news is that it seems
	   to be a rare case, and it can be avoided by the user by
	   hiding 'x' before renaming 'y':

	     %rename(_x) Foo::x();
	     %rename(x) Foo::y();
	   

12/08/2003: mmatus (Marcelo Matus)
	    The virtual method detections now properly
	    treats the following cases:

             namespace foo { typedef int Int; }
	     struct A {};
	     typedef A B;

             struct Foo {
               virtual ~Foo() {}

               virtual Foo* cloner() = 0;
	       virtual int get_value() = 0;
	       virtual A* get_class() = 0;
	       virtual void just_do_it() = 0;
	     };

             struct Bar : Foo
             {
               Bar* cloner();
               foo::Int get_value();
               B* get_class();
               void just_do_it();
             };
 
            All the Foo and Bar methods are virtual.  A new attribute
	    "virtual:type" record the base polymorphic type. In the
	    previous cases we have:

	       type : Bar       virtual:type : Foo
	       type : foo::Int  virtual:type : int
	       type : B         virtual:type : A
	       type : void      virtual:type : void

            This attribute is useful in languages (java+directors)
	    that could have problems redefining Bar* Bar::cloner().

	    If you never had code like the above, you will see no
	    effects. But if you have some code like that, you
	    will see some effects since some methods that
	    before were not properly treated as virtual,
	    will start to act like that. This could enlarge
	    your director classes.
	    

12/08/2003: mmatus (Marcelo Matus)
	    The director protected member support (dirprot)
	    is disabled by default.
	    
	    It can be enable by using '-dirprot' or by adding
	    the option to the module declaration, like:

            %module(directors="1",dirprot="1") my_module

	    This module option was added to properly compile the
	    director_protected.i and director_nested.i examples.
	    
	    The feature has been tested with python[2.2,2.3] 
	    and ruby[1.6.7], both at compilation and runtime, and 
	    java[j2sdk1.4.1_01], but only at compilation (my java
	    installation doesn't run any of the director examples,
	    olds nor news).

	    Please test for ocaml and java.
	    
	    The errors reported by William and Scott were fixed,
	    except for a warning about  SWIG_JavaThrowExecption()
	    multiply defined. I can't reproduce this error with my
	    examples. We will wait for Scott to send us a minimal
	    case.


12/07/2003: mmatus (Marcelo Matus)
	    The director protected member support has been
	    completly moved out from python.cxx, and now
	    resides in the common lang.cxx, emit.cxx and
	    allocate.cxx files. 

	    This means it should work for all the other languages
	    that currently support directors, ie, python, java, ocalm
	    and ruby.

	    The change has been tested with python (compilation+runtime)
	    and java (just compilation).
	    
	    Please add runtime tests for the missing languages 
	    and test it.

	    The '-nodirprot' option was moved to the principal main,
	    and can be used from all the languages.

            [Java] Fixed and improved error checking of STRING_OUT typemaps in 
            various.i.

12/04/2003: mmatus (Marcelo Matus)

	    - Now the virtual members with no explicit declarator
	    are properly identified:
	    
                struct A  {
                 virtual int f() = 0;
                };

                struct B : A {
                  int f();
                };

	    Here, B::f() is virtual, and the director and the
	    virtual elimination mechanism now recognize that.

            - [C#] This fix also fixes the problem where 'override' was not being 
            used on any overridden virtual method, so for struct B above, 
            this C# code is generated:

                public class B : A {
                  ...
                  public override int f() {
                    ...
                  }
                  ...
                }

	    - Initial support for protected virtual methods. They are now
	    properly emitted when using with director (python only by
	    now).
	    
                %feature("director") A;    
                struct A  {
                protected:
                 virtual int f1() = 0;
                };

                %feature("director") B;
                struct B : A{
                protected:
                  int f1();
                  virtual f2();
                };

	    This can be dissabled by using the '-nodirprot' option.

	    - The feature 'nodirector' is working now at the top level,
	    so, it must work for all the languages:

                %feature("director") A;
                %feature("nodirector") A::f2;

                struct A {
                 virtual int f1();
                 virtual int f2();
                };
                
	    in this case, only 'f1' is exported to the director class.
	    
	    - Added director support for const TYPE& arguments (python).

            [Java] Fix for INOUT and OUTPUT typemaps in typemaps.i for when the JNI type 
            is bigger than the C type. For example, unsigned long (32bits on most systems)

            Fixed [ 756552 ] missing default argument class scope with "|".
            This is really only a band-aid fix for use of class-enums in
            expressions.  For example:

                  class A {
                  public:
                     enum Flag { flag1 = 0x1, flag2 = 0x2 };
                     void foo(int x = flag1 | flag2);
                  };

            Note: there are still some (more subtle) cases that are broken,
            but hard to fix due to an issue with template expansion. Will
            address later.

            Incorporated [ 840878 ] support for %inline { ... } (PATCH).
            This adds support for the following:

                  %inline {
                      ... some code ...
                  }

            The difference between this and %inline %{ ... %} is that the
            enclosed text is processed by the SWIG preprocessor.   This
            allows special macros and other processing to be used in 
            conjunction with %inline.

11/25/2003: beazley
            Fixed [ 836903 ] C++ inconsistency (with void arguments).
            SWIG was having difficulty with f() vs f(void) in C++ programs.
            For instance:

                  class A {
                  public:
                      virtual void f(void) = 0;
                  };

                  class B {
                  public:
                      virtual void f();    // Not matched to f(void) correctly
                  }; 

            The parser now normalizes all declarations of the form f(void) 
            in C++ classes to f().  This should fix a variety of subtle 
            problems with inheritance, optimizations, overloading, etc.

            [Tcl] Fixed problem with cross module linking.  Previously modules referred
            to base classes through a global variable.   Now, the module looks up base
            classes through the type system itself---avoiding the need to link to a global
            like before.  Caveat:  modules with base classes must be loaded before
            modules with derived classes.

            Changes to the SWIG runtime library support. 
              -  The -c command line option has been renamed to -noruntime
              -  New command line option: -runtime.  When supplied, this
                 inserts the symbol SWIG_GLOBAL into the wrapper code.  This,

                 visible.

	    can be used to specify the tree where Guile is
	    installed.  (However, usually it suffices to use the

11/17/2003: mkoeppe (Matthias Koeppe)
	    [Guile] Improvements to object-ownership management in 
	    "-scm" mode.  (They do not apply to the default "-gh" mode.)
	    * Renamed the smob type that indicates that the object can
	      be garbage collected from "collected swig" to "collectable
	      swig", which is more precise.  
	    * Export the destructor functions again.  It is now
 	      allowed to explicitly call destructors, even for
	      garbage-collected pointer objects.  A pointer object
	      that has been passed to a destructor is marked in a
	      special way using a new smob type, "destroyed swig".
	      (This helps avoid nasty memory bugs, where references to
	      dead C objects are still held in Scheme. Moreover, the
	      garbage collector will not try to free a destroyed
	      object once more.)
	    * Destructor-like functions can also mark their arguments 
	      as destroyed by applying the typemap SWIGTYPE *DESTROYED.
	      (It calls the function SWIG_Guile_MarkPointerDestroyed.)
	    * Functions that "consume" their objects (or that "own"
	      them after the call) can mark their arguments as
	      not garbage collectable.  This can be done by applying
	      the typemap SWIGTYPE *CONSUMED.  (It calls the function
	      SWIG_Guile_MarkPointerNoncollectable.)
	    * The macro TYPEMAP_POINTER_INPUT_OUTPUT from library
	      pointer-in-out.i creates additional typemaps 
	      PTRTYPE *INPUT_CONSUMED, PTRTYPE *INPUT_DESTROYED.
	      They mark the passed pointer object likewise.
	      The typemap PTRTYPE *OUTPUT creates a garbage-collectable
	      pointer object, like %newobject does for a returned 
	      pointer.  Use the new typemap PTRTYPE *OUTPUT_NONCOLLECTABLE
	      to create a pointer object that will not be garbage collected.

            [Python] When generating proxy class code, SWIG emits a few
            default methods for __repr__() and other Python special
            methods.  Some of these methods are emitted after all of the
            contents of a class. However, this makes it hard to override
            the methods using %pythoncode and some other directives that
            allow code to be inserted into a class.  These special methods
            are now emitted into the code *before* all of the other methods.
            Suggested by Eric Jones.

            Preprocessor enhancement.   For include statements like this:

                  %include "foo/bar.i"

            the directory "foo" is now added to the search path while 
            processing the contents of bar.i.  Thus, if bar.i includes other
            files in the same directory, they will be found. Previously,
            you would have to add additional directories using -I to make this
            work correctly.  Note: the C preprocessor seems to behave in
            an identical manner on many (most? all?) systems.

            Incorporated patch: [ 829325 ] new Python Module options and features.
            Robin Dunn writes:

            This patch makes a number of changes to the SWIG python module.

            1. Add -apply option, and change the default code
            output to use the foo(*args, **kw) calling syntax
            instead of using apply(). If the -apply option is
            given then code is generated as before. This is very
            similar to Patch #737281 but the new -modern option
            makes the second half of that patch unnecessary so it
            is not included here.
	    
            2. Add -new_repr option. This is the same as my Patch
            #797002 which I will mark as closed since it is no
            longer needed. When this new option is used then the
            __repr__ methods that are generated for proxy classes
            will be more informative and give details about the
            python class and the C++ class.
	    
            3. Add %feature("addtofunc"). It allows you to insert
            one or more lines of code inside the shadow method or
            function that is already generated, instead of
            replacing the whole thing like %feature("shadow") does.
            For __init__ it goes at the end, for __del__ it goes
            at the begining and for all others the code generated
            is expanded out to be like
	    
            def Bar(*args, **kwargs):
            val = _module.Foo_Bar(*args, **kwargs)
            return val
	    
            and the "addtofunc" code is inserted just before the
            return statement. If the feature is not used for a
            particular method or function then the shorter code is
            generated just like before.
	    
            4. A little bit of refactoring to make implementing
            addtofunc a little easier.
	    
            5. Added a -modern command-line flag that will cause
            SWIG to omit the cruft in the proxy modules that allows
            it to work with versions of Python prior to 2.2. The
            result is a simpler, cleaner and faster python proxy
            module, but one that requires Python 2.2 or greater.

            Incorporated patch: [ 829319 ] XML module tweaks.

            [C#] IntPtr marshalled with a void* instead of int in C function 
            declarations. The casts thus look more conventional, for example:

                // old
                DllExport double SWIGSTDCALL CSharp_get_Shape_x(int jarg1) {
                    ...
                    Shape *arg1 = (Shape *) 0 ;
                    arg1 = *(Shape **)&jarg1; 
                    ...
                }
                // new
                DllExport double SWIGSTDCALL CSharp_get_Shape_x(void * jarg1) {
                    ...
                    Shape *arg1 = (Shape *) 0 ;
                    arg1 = (Shape *)jarg1; 
                    ...
                }


10/14/2003: beazley
            Fixed a subtle problem with overloaded methods and smart pointers.
            If a class has overloaded methods like this:

                 class Foo {
                 public:
                     int bar(int x);
                     static int bar(int x, int y);
                 };

            and the class is used as a smart pointer:

                class FooPtr {
                public:
                     Foo *operator->();
                };

            The SWIG would try to expose the static member Foo::bar
            through FooPtr---resulting bogus wrapper code and a compiler
            error.

            Due to the way in which overloading is handled, it is
            extremely difficult to eliminate the static method in
            this case.  Therefore, it is still exposed.  However,
            the generated code now compiles and works.

            [C#] - Typemaps added for std::string and const std::string &.
                 - New delegate for creating a C# string given a char *. It
                   can be used by calling SWIG_csharp_string_callback as shown
                   in the std::string 'out' typemap. Useful if the return type is
                   mapped to a C# string and the calling function is responsible 
                   for cleaning up memory as the C# garbage collector doesn't
                   free the memory created in C/C++ and then returned as a C# string.
                 - The exception delegates have moved into an inner class in the
                   intermediate class, thereby freeing up the static constructor.

            (Internals)
            Major refactoring of iteration over lists and hashes.  The
            DOH library now uses iterators.  They work like this:

                List *l = (some list);

                Iterator i;
                for (i = First(l); i.item; i = Next(i)) {
                    // i.item contains the actual list item.
                    // i.item is NULL at end of list
                    ...
                }

                Hash *h = (some hash);
                Iterator j;
                for (j = First(h); j.item; j = Next(j)) {
                    // j.item contains hash table item
                    // j.key  contains hash table key
                    // Both j.item and j.key are NULL at end
                    ...
                }
 
            The old iteration functions Firstitem(), Nextitem(), Firstkey(),
            and Nextkey() are gone.  

            The new iterators are simpler, result in better memory use,
            and may be faster.  Also, there are no longer any problems
            iterating over the same list/hash in multiple places at
            the same time.  For example, this is fine:

                 Iterator i,j;
                 for (i = First(l); i.item; i = Next(i)) {
                    for (j = First(l); j.item; j = Next(j)) {
                         ...
                    }
                 }

            (This never worked in previous versions).
            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***.  This will probably break 
            third party extensions to SWIG (or give them further encouragement
            to join the SWIG CVS-tree :-).

            Test-suite build improvements:
            - Multiple build directories working for the test suite, so it is now
              possible to run configure in multiple subdirectories and run the test
              suite in each of these sub directories.
            - 'make distclean' fixed so it doesn't bomb out on the Examples directory
              when using multiple subdiretory builds. Required the following directories
              to be moved:
                Examples/GIFPlot/Perl -> Examples/GIFPlot/Perl5
                Examples/GIFPlot/Php  -> Examples/GIFPlot/Php4
              These new directories used to be symbolic links to the old directory.
              Also the Examples/test-suite/Perl symbolic link has been removed.
            - Running the test-suite, other than from the root directory, say
              in Examples/test-suite/python will now display all the code being
              executed.
            - The following 3 C# compilers are detected during configure and work with 
              the test-suite: Mono, Portable.NET and Microsoft.

            Fixed [ 794914 ] Wrong types in template specialization.
            SWIG was not handling arguments correctly in template 
            partial specialization.  For example,

                template<class T> class Foo<T *> {
                public:
                    T *blah();
                };

                %template(FooInt) Foo<int *>;

            in this class, the return type of blah was set to
            'int **', but it should really be 'int *'.  This has been
            fixed, but it will affect all prior uses of partial
            specialization.

            Completed initial support for wrapping abstract classes with directors.
	    Constructor wrappers will be generated for abstract classes that have

	    of whether the proxy class has been subclassed in the target language.
	    No checks are made during construction to ensure that all pure virtual
	    methods are implemented in the target language.  Instead, calls to
	    unimplemented methods will throw SWIG_DIRECTOR_PURE_VIRTUAL_EXCEPTION
	    exceptions in C++.

	    Integrated Prabhu Ramachandran's typemap patches, which provide director
	    typemap support for enums and std::size_t, and fix a couple bugs in the 
	    director std::vector<> typemaps.

08/29/2003: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [C#] Implemented exception handling for throwing C# exceptions from C/C++ code.
            A few delegate functions are available for calling which then throw the C#
            exception. Use the SWIG_CSharpThrowException function from C/C++ typemaps.
            See the generated wrapper code or csharphead.swg for all available exceptions.
            Example:

              SWIG_CSharpThrowException(SWIG_CSharpException, "exception description");

            The 'throws' typemaps are also now implemented, so code is automatically 
            generated to convert any C++ exception into a C# System.Exception when the C++ 
            method declares an exception specification such as:

               int foo() throw(Bar);

            Also any parameters that are references to a C++ class or a class passed by value
            and are passed as a C# null will now throw a C# NullReferenceException.

            javadestruct/javadestruct_derived (Java) or csdestruct/csdestruct_derived (C#)
            typemaps specifies the method name. For example in Java the destructor is

            [C#] A number of changes have been made to remove the Java naming 
            that was used in the C# module.
            
            Typemap name changes:
            jni                         -> ctype
            jtype                       -> imtype

            javainterfaces              -> csinterfaces
            javabase                    -> csbase
            javaclassmodifiers          -> csclassmodifiers

            javafinalize                -> csfinalize

            Feature name changes:
            javaconst                   -> csconst
            javamethodmodifiers         -> csmethodmodifiers

            Pragma changes:
            pragma(java)                -> pragma(csharp)
            jniclassbase                -> imclassbase
            jniclassclassmodifiers      -> imclassclassmodifiers
            jniclasscode                -> imclasscode
            jniclassimports             -> imclassimports
            jniclassinterfaces          -> imclassinterfaces

            Special variable name changes:
            $javaclassname              -> $csclassname
            $javainput                  -> $csinput
            $jnicall                    -> $imcall

            This will break SWIG interface files that use these typemaps, features
            and pragmas. Please update your code or use macros for backwards
            compatibility.

	    [MzScheme] Applied MzScheme module updates contributed by
	    John Lenz <jelenz@students.wisc.edu>.

            - Updated mzscheme to use SWIG's common runtime type
              system from common.swg. 

	    - The Lib/mzscheme directory has been reorganized to
              standardize names across the language modules:
              mzscheme.i was moved to mzscheme.swg, mzscheme.swg and
              mzschemedec.swg have been removed, mzrun.swg (which
              contains the runtime code) has been added.

            - The swig_proxy structure was renamed to swig_mz_proxy.
              swig_mz_proxy now contains a pointer to a swig_type_info
              structure.  

	    - Added varin and varout typemaps for SWIGTYPE [] and
              SWIGTYPE &.

	    - Garbage collection by calling scheme_add_finalizer() has
              been added.

            [Java] New typemaps: javadestruct and javadestruct_derived
            for the C++ destructor wrapper. The javadestruct version gets used by
            classes at the top of an inheritance chain and the javadestruct_derived 
            version gets used by other classes.

            [C#] cildispose and cildisposeoverride typemaps replaced by
            csdestruct and csdestruct_derived typemaps. The delete()
            method has been removed and its functionality put into these
            typemaps designed for the Dispose() method.

            - New typemaps csinterfaces and csinterfaces_derived replace
            the javainterfaces typemap. Also fixes the peculiarity of all classes
            in an inheritance chain individually deriving from the IDisposable 
            interface.

            - New typemap csfinalize for finalizers. C++ destructors are now called
            by garbage collector during finalization. Problem reported by 
            Andreas Schörk.

	    [Guile] Applied Guile module updates contributed by 
	    John Lenz <jelenz@students.wisc.edu>. 

	    - SWIG currently uses Guile's gh_ API, which is marked as
	      deprecated in Guile 1.6 and will be removed in Guile
	      1.9.  This change introduces a command-line flag "-scm"
	      which causes SWIG to generate wrappers that use Guile's
	      SCM API instead; this requires Guile >= 1.6.
	    
	    - The Lib/guile directory has been reorganized to
              standardize names across language modules: guiledec.swg
              and guile.swg have been moved into guile_gh_run.swg,
              guile.i has been moved to guile_gh.swg, guile_scm.swg
              and guile_scm_run.swg which contain the SCM API stuff
              have been added

	    - ghinterface.i, which contains the defines from the gh_
              functions to the scm_functions has been added

	    - The API for dealing with pointer objects is now
	      SWIG_ConvertPtr, SWIG_MustGetPtr, SWIG_NewPointerObj.

            - Added varin and varout typemaps for SWIGTYPE [] and SWIGTYPE &

            - Garbage collection has been added.

            Dimensionless arrays such as 

                int foo[] = {1, 2};
                extern int bar[];

            produce a warning that the variable is read-only. Depending on the target
            language, this used to cause compile errors or generate a setter that
            generated a runtime error. A setter cannot be automatically generated
            because the array size cannot be determined by SWIG. A varin, globalin 
            or memberin typemap (depending on the target language) must be written 
            by the user.

05/29/2003: beazley
            Refinement to default typemap matching and arrays.  When an
            array is declared like this:

                       int foo[4];

            The default typemap now resolves to 

                       SWIGTYPE [ANY]

            If no match is found for that, it then resolves to

                       SWIGTYPE []

            If no array dimension is specified in the original declaration,
            the SWIGTYPE [] is used right away. 

            Note: This change has been made to resolve problems related to
            arrays with and without dimensions.  For example, sometimes SWIG
            was generating setter functions for array variables with no dimensions
            (an error). Likewise, SWIG sometimes made arrays with dimensions
            read-only (also an error).  This fixes the arrays_global test
            problem.

            Fixed subtle type handling bug with references and pointers.
            If you had functions like this:

                  Foo *func1();
                  void func2(Bar &x);

            Then func2() wouldn't accept objects returned by func1()
            because of a type error.   It should work now.

            Added -contracts option.
            First try of the idea of "Wrap by Contract": 
            build up realiable cross-language module by wrapping with SWIG.
            Implemented basic assertion
            (preassertion & postassertion & invariant)
            for simple C/C++ functions.
            
            Current format of contracts are:
            %contract class_name :: func_name (paras...) {
            require:
                   boolean exprs;
                   exprs;
            ensure:

            Build tweaks. There were a few preprocessor definitions which were
            specified in the Makefile for passing on the commandline when compiling.
            These are now all defined in swigconfig.h. Autoconf doesn't normally 
            allow installation directories to be defined in this config header file, 
            but an autoconf archive macro enables this. This macro along with future 
            autoconf macros are going to be put in the Tools/config directory.

            'swig -version' now reports the target build platform.

            [C# and Java] Fix to the following typemaps:

            javabase, javainterfaces, javaimports, javaclassmodifiers,
            javaptrconstructormodifiers, javafinalize, javagetcptr & javacode.

            These are the typemaps for modifying/generating proxy classes.
            Previously the typemaps would use the proxy class name and not the 
            C++ type, which was inconsistent with all other typemaps. 

            In most circumstances the proxy class name and the C++ class name/type 
            is the same except for classes in namespace, templated classes etc. so
            this shouldn't affect most cases.

            Build changes:
            - Single autoconf invocation - autoconf in the Tools directory has gone.

            - Libtool bootstrapped when running autogen.sh. This requires anyone
              using the cvs version of SWIG to have libtool installed on their
              machine. Suggest version 1.4.2 or higher, preferably the latest - 1.5.

            - Automake is now used to build the runtime libraries in conjunction 
              with libtool.

            - Runtime libraries are now successfully built as DLLs on Cygwin.

            - Skipping languages is no longer just determined in the top level 
              makefile but in configure.in. This info is used for building
              the runtime libraries and for running the examples and test-suite.

            - These changes have fixed multiple build directory builds, that is
              building from directories other than the top level directory. 
              Installation from multiple build directories also working. An initial
              configure in the top level directory is no longer needed as described
              in 04/02/2003 entry. A 'make distclean' will be needed before building
              in a directory other than the top level directory if the autotools 
              have been run from this top level directory at some point, but 
              autoconf will tell you this. Note that 'make check' only works from 
              the top level directory at the moment.

            Minor refinement of const static member variable handling 
            described in CHANGES 08/11/2002.   Previously, SWIG merely
            checked to see if there was an initializer in the declaration.
            Now, SWIG additionally checks to make sure the static member
            is const.

            [C#] Improved wrapping of enums and constants. These were previously
            wrapped as C# variables rather than constants. Either these are wrapped
            as readonly (runtime) constants or compile time constants, depending on
            the %javaconst directive (The directive is likely to change name soon).
            For example wrapping:
              %javaconst(0);
              #define ABC 22
              %javaconst(1) XYZ;
              #define XYZ 33
            is now:
              public static readonly int ABC = examplePINVOKE.get_ABC();
              public const int XYZ = 33;

04/03/2003: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Global constants and enums are put in their own interface called
            xxxConstants, where xxx is the module name. This is an improvement as 
            it is possible to derive (implement) a Java class from the xxxConstants
            interface to improve the syntax; namely when wrapping:
              enum {ONE=1, TWO, THREE};
            accessing these from a Java class implementing xxxConstants is neater:
              int number = ONE;
            than the previous:
              int number = xxx.ONE;

            Patch submitted by Dave Dribin.

04/02/2003: cheetah (William Fulton)
            Build improvements for multiple builds. This allows one to build
            the SWIG executable and runtime libraries for different platforms/compilers 
            etc by running configure in different directories. This isn't 100% just 
            yet and won't be until libtool is better configured... a 'configure' and 
            'make distclean' needs to be run in the root directory before it all works.
            For example:
              $ ./configure
              $ make distclean
              $ mkdir config1; cd config1; ../configure CC=gcc CXX=g++; make; cd ..
              $ mkdir config2; cd config2; ../configure CC=cc CXX=c++; make; cd ..
            
            To be improved. A 'make check' does not work yet either.

            Fixed a C++ scoping bug related to code like this:

                class Foo {
                public:
                     int Foo::bar();
                };

            Previously, SWIG just tossed out the Foo::bar() declaration. Now,
            the declaration is wrapped provided that the prefix is exactly the
            same as the current scope (including any enclosing namespaces).
            Reported by Bruce Lowery.

            Incorporated [ 696516 ] Enabling exception processing for data member access.
            In some compilers, attribute access can generate exceptions.  However,
            SWIG ordinarily assumes that no exceptions will be raised.  To disable this,
            use the %feature("allowexcept").  For example:

                  %feature("allowexcept") Foo::x;
                  ...
                  class Foo {
                  public:
                      int x;     /* Exception handling enabled */
                      ...

            [C# and Java] Added missing vararg support.

03/18/2003: mrose (Mark Rose)
            Removed code related to tagging individual methods for directors.
	    The concept of having directors for some but not all virtual methods
	    of a class is deeply flawed.  The %feature("nodirector") tag is also
	    gone.  
	    
	    Directors are off by default.  To enable them for a class, issue
	    %feature("director") classname; which will create director methods
	    for every virtual method in the hierarchy of the class.

03/17/2003: beazley
            Fixed a subtle problem with passing arguments of type function.  For
            example:

               int foo(int x(int, int));

            or

               typedef int binop_t(int, int);
               int foo(binop_t x);

            In old versions, this would produce code that wouldn't compile.  Now,
            SWIG merely adds an extra pointer, making these declarations the same
            as:

               int foo(int (*x)(int, int));

               typedef int binop_t(int, int);
               int foo(binop_t *x);

            Reported by Garth Bushell.

            Fixed the return statement for director base class calls that have no
            return value.

03/15/2003: beazley
            Fixed a problem with const smart-pointer wrapping.  For example:

                 class Foo {
                 public:
                    int x;
                    void bar() const;
                    void spam();
                };

                class Blah {
                ...
                   const Foo *operator->();
                ...
                };

            In this case, only "x" and "bar" are visible from Blah (since application
            of spam violates constness).  Moreover, access to "x" is read-only.

03/13/2003: mrose (Mark Rose)
            Fixed a bug in the virtual method unrolling for directors. 
	    The order of unrolling is now from base to derived, to ensure
	    that the most derived implementation of a director method is
	    found.

	    Director methods for pure virtual methods now throw
	    DIRECTOR_PURE_VIRTUAL_EXCEPTION if _up is set.

03/12/2003: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [C#] Polymorphism fix: virtual functions now use the appropriate

03/11/2003: beazley
            The $descriptor(type) variable is now expanded in code supplied to

            Fixed problem with escape sequences in string and character constants.  SWIG
            wasn't parsing certain octal codes correctly.

03/07/2003: beazley
            Fixed a variety of subtle preprocessor problems reported by
            Sebastien Recio.

            (a) Empty preprocessor values no longer generate "bad constant
            value" errors.  For example:

                  #define FOO
                  #define FOO BAR

            (b) Macro names can now span multiple lines (technically valid,
            although questionable practice).  For example:

                  #define A_LONG_MACRO_\
                  NAME 42

            (c) Whitespace is no longer required before certain macro values.
            For example:

                  #define FOO"Hello"
                  #define BAR\
                  "Hello"

            [Ruby] Added missing long long and unsigned long long typemaps
            in the Lib/ruby/typemaps.i library file.

03/07/2003: mrose (Mark Rose)
            Added Examples/python/callback to demostrate how directors can
	    be used to implement callbacks in Python
	    Added Examples/python/extend to demonstrate virtual method
	    calls from C++ to Python (really the same as the callback
	    example, just a different context).
	    Added four tests for very basic director functionality.  These
	    have runtime tests under python.
	    The Python module now emits #define SWIG_DIRECTORS near the
	    top of the output file if directors are enabled.  This is useful
	    for disabling parts of tests in target languages that don't
	    support directors.

03/06/2003: mrose (Mark Rose)
            Added a section to Doc/Manual/Python.html on cross language
	    polymorphism (directors).

03/06/2003: mrose (Mark Rose)
            The short-lived "-fdirectors" command line option has been
	    removed.  To enable directors, instead use the extended %module 
	    directive as follows:

	        %module(directors="1") modulename

03/06/2003: cheetah (William Fulton)
            The long long typemaps have been rewritten so that they can be more
            easily used with non ISO compilers, like Visual C++. For example
            if you are wrapping the Windows 64 bit type __int64 the long long
            typemaps can be used with %apply:

                %apply long long { __int64 };
                __int64 value1(__int64 x);

            __int64 will now appear in the generated code instead of long long.
            
03/06/2003: beazley
            *** DEVELOPER CHANGE ***
            Swig module mutation has been changed slightly.  When a language
            class method wants to save node attributes, it now uses one of the
            following functions:

                  Swig_require()
                  Swig_save()

            The first argument to these functions is a namespace in which
            saved attributes are placed.  For example,this code

                  Node *n;
                  Swig_save("cDeclaration",n,"type","parms","name",NIL);

            saves the attributes as "cDeclaration:type", "cDeclaration:parms",
            and so forth.   If necessary, a language module can refer to
            old values by using this special namespace qualifier.

            In addition to this, a special attribute "view" contains the name
            of the last namespace used to save attributes.  In the above 
            example, "view" would have the value "cDeclaration".   The value
            of "cDeclaration:view" would have the previous view and so forth.

            Swig_restore(n) restores a node to the state before the last
            Swig_require() or Swig_save() call.

            Note:  This change makes it easier for language modules to refer
            to old values of attributes.  


03/06/2003: mrose (Mark Rose)
            Merged the cross-language polymorphism patch.  When enabled, C++ 
	    "proxy" classes (called directors) are generated for each specified 
	    C++ class.  Directors pass method calls from C++ to Python, similar 
	    to the way the usual proxy (shadow) classes pass method calls from 
	    Python to C++.  Together, these two types of proxies allow C++ 
	    classes that are extended in Python to behave just like ordinary 
	    C++ classes and be used in C++ like native objects.  
	    
	    This feature is still very experimental and is disabled by default.
	    To enable director support, specify '-fdirectors' on the SWIG command
	    line or in the SWIG_FEATURES environment variable.  In the interface
	    file, add %feature("director") to generate directors for all classes
	    that have virtual methods.  
	    
	    See http://stm.lbl.gov/~tm2/swig/ProxyDoc.html for more details.
	    

03/03/2003: beazley
            Fixed a small glitch in typemap local variable replacement.  If you had
            a typemap like this:

                 %typemap(in) type ($1_type temp) {
                      ...
                      temp = ...;
                      ...
                 }

            and no occurrence of "$1_type" appeared in the body, then the local
            variable type wouldn't be substituted.

            [C#] New version of the CSharp module which is typemap based.
            It also uses ECMA C# and no longer uses Microsoft Visual C++.NET

02/27/2003: beazley
            Fixed [ 653548 ] error parsing casting operator definition.
            SWIG now ignores casting operators declared outside of a class.
            For example:

                inline A::operator char *() { ... }

            Bug reported by Martin Casado.

02/27/2003: beazley
            Added support for anonymous bit-fields.  For example:

                 struct Foo {
                      int x : 4;
                      int   : 4;
                      int y : 8;
                 };

            Anonymous bit-fields are ignored by SWIG.   Problem

02/26/2003: beazley
            Fixed [ 675337 ] Partial template specialization not entirely working.
            There was a subtle problem related to the naming and ordering of
            template partial specialization arguments.  Matching worked okay,
            the resulting templates weren't expanded correctly.

02/25/2003: beazley
            Fixed problem with parsing (and generating code) for

02/25/2003: beazley
            Fixed a subtle problem with virtual method implementation
            checking and typedef.

                 typedef int *intptr;

                 struct A {
                    virtual int *foo() = 0;
                 };
                 struct B : public A {
                    virtual intptr foo() { };
                 };

            SWIG was treating these declarations as different even though
            they are the same (via typedef).

02/25/2003: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] Added range checking for the NUM2USHRT macro, per [ 675353 ].

02/24/2003: beazley
            Fixed a subtle problem with the code that determined if a class is abstract
            and can be instantiated.    If you had classes like this:

                  struct A {
                     virtual int foo(int) = 0;
                  };
                  struct B : virtual A {
                     virtual int foo(int);
                  };

                  struct C : virtual A { 
                  };

                  /* Note order of base classes */	
                  struct D : B, C { };    /* Ok */
                  struct E : C, B { };    /* Broken */

            then SWIG determined that it could instantiate D(), but not E().
            This inconsistency arose from the depth-first search of the 
            inheritance hierarchy to locate the implementations of virtual
            methods.   This problem should now be fixed---SWIG will attempt
            to locate any valid implementation of a virtual method by
            traversing over the entire hierarchy.

            [Ruby] Improved support for Visual C++ and other native Windows compilers. 
            It is no longer necessary to specify "/EXPORT:Init_<module>", where <module> is the
            swig module name when linking using these native Windows compilers.

02/15/2003: songyanf (Tiger)
            Added -fvirtual option.
            Reduce the lines and size of the wrapper file
            by omitting redifined virtual function in children classes.

            Modified -compact option to -fcompact option

            Added -small option.
            -small = -fvirtual -fcompact
            And it can be extended by future feature options,
            which are used to reduce wrapper file szie.

            Added SWIG_FEATURES environment variable check.

02/11/2003: beazley
            Fixed more very subtle preprocessor corner cases related to recursive
            macro expansion.  For example:

                   cat(cat(1,2),3)    // Produces: cat(1,2)3
                   
                   #define xcat(x,y) cat(x,y)

                   xcat(xcat(1,2),3)  // Produces 123

            Further build changes:
            - The SWIG executable is now built using a single Makefile.
            - This makefile is generated by Automake (Source/Makefile.am).
            - Dependency tracking and tags support are in this makefile.
            - Automake 1.7.2 and Autoconf 2.54 minimum versions are needed to build SWIG from CVS.
            - Running ./autogen.sh now installs Autoconf/Automake support files into
              Tools/config and these files are no longer stored in CVS.
            - Bug fixes in 'make install' for systems using .exe executable extension and
              ./configure --with-release-suffix=whatever

            - Using standard autoconf config header generation.
            - Updated old autoconf macros as reported by autoupdate.
            - Removed $prefix in autoconf from search paths as autoconf won't expand them.
            - Subtle bug fix where 'make prefix=/somewhere; make clean; make prefix=/somwhere/else'
              produced an executable using the incorrect library directories.
            - Added -ldflags commandline option for MzScheme, Ocaml, Pike and PHP.

11/14/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Handling of NULL pointers is improved. A java null object will now
            be translated to and from a NULL C/C++ pointer by default. Previously when 
            wrapping:

                class SomeClass {...};
                void foo(SomeClass *s);

            and it was called from Java with null:

                modulename.foo(null)

            a Java NullPointerException was thrown. Extra typemaps had to be written in
            order to obtain a NULL pointer to pass to functions like this one. Now the 
            default wrapping will detect 'null' and translate it into a NULL pointer.
            Also if a function returns a NULL pointer, eg:
            
                SomeClass *bar() { return NULL; }
            
            Then this used to be wrapped with a SomeClass proxy class holding a NULL
            pointer. Now null is returned instead. These changes are subtle but useful.
            The original behaviour can be obtained by using the original typemaps:

                %typemap(javaout) SWIGTYPE {
                    return new $&javaclassname($jnicall, true);
                  }
                %typemap(javaout) SWIGTYPE *, SWIGTYPE &, SWIGTYPE [] {
                    return new $javaclassname($jnicall, $owner);
                  }
                %typemap(javagetcptr) SWIGTYPE, SWIGTYPE *, SWIGTYPE &, SWIGTYPE [] %{
                  protected static long getCPtr($javaclassname obj) {
                    return obj.swigCPtr;
                  }

                int meth(int meth_param_1, int meth_param_2) { return 0; }
            };

            In this case, abstract_bar is still abstract.

            and a typemap:

               %typemap() char [ANY] {
                   ... $1_dim0 ...
               }

            then $1_dim* variables weren't be expanded properly.  It should work now.

11/06/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Default primitive array handling has changed like arrays of classes. 
            C primitive arrays are no longer wrapped by a Java array but with a pointer 
            (type wrapper class). Again the changes have been made for efficiency reasons. 
            The original typemaps have been moved into arrays_java.i, so the original 
            behaviour can be obtained merely including this file:

                %include "arrays_java.i"

            The array support functions are no longer generated by default. They are only
            generated when including this file, thus this often unused code is only
            generated when specifically requiring this type of array support.

            [Ruby] Added support for nested module declarations (as was

            of the form:

                %module "Outer::Inner::Foo"

            will nest everything as (in Ruby code):

                module Outer
                  module Inner
                    module Foo

            [Java] Added patch submitted by Michael Cahill to remove unused parameter
            warnings for the jenv and cls parameters. This patch also also allows one
            to use "void" in the jni typemap for any type without code being generated
            attempting to return a value.

10/29/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Array handling is different. Arrays of classes are no longer wrapped
            with proxy arrays, eg wrapping

                class X {...};
                X foo[10];
            
            used to be wrapped with these Java getters and setters:

                public static void setFoo(X[] value) {...}
                public static X[] getFoo() {...}

            This approach is very inefficient as the entire array is copied numerous
            times on each invocation of the getter or setter. These arrays are now
            wrapped with a pointer so it is only possible to access the first array element 
            using a proxy class:

                public static void setFoo(X value) {...}
                public static X getFoo() {...}

            Arrays of enums have also been similarly changed. This behaviour is now like the 
            other SWIG language's implementation and the array library should be used to 
            access the other elements. The original behaviour can be achieved using the 
            macros and typemaps in arrays_java.i, for example:

                %include "arrays_java.i"
                JAVA_ARRAYSOFCLASSES(X)
                class X {...};
                X foo[10];

10/29/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Two new typemaps javain and javaout for generating the proxy class 
            and type wrapper class method calls to the JNI class. The new typemaps are 
            really used for transforming the jstype (used in proxy class and type wrapper
            classes) to the jtype (used in the JNI class) and visa versa. A javain typemap
            is required whenever an in typemap is written and similarly javaout for an out
            typemap. An example is probably best to show them working:

                %typemap(javain) Class "Class.getCPtr($javainput)"
                %typemap(javain) unsigned short "$javainput"
                %typemap(javaout) Class * {
                    return new Class($jnicall, $owner);
                  }

                %inline %{
                    class Class {};
                    Class * bar(Class cls, unsigned short ush) { return new Class(); };
                %}

            The generated proxy code is then:

                public static Class bar(Class cls, int ush) {
                  return new Class(exampleJNI.bar(Class.getCPtr(cls), ush), false);
                }


            Some new special variables have been introduced in order to use these typemaps.
            Here $javainput has been replaced by 'cls' and 'ush'. $jnicall has been replaced by 
            the native method call, 'exampleJNI.bar(...)' and $owner has been replaced by 'false'.
            $javainput is analogous to the $input special variable. It is replaced by the parameter name.
            $jnicall is analogous to $action in %exception. It is replaced by the call to the native
            method in the JNI class.
            $owner is replaced by either true if %newobject has been used otherwise false.

            The java.swg file contains default javain and javout typemaps which will produce the same code
            as previously. This change is only of concern to those who have written their own typemaps as
            you will then most likely have to write your own javain and javaout typemaps.

            The javaout typemap also makes it possible to use a Java downcast to be used on abstract 
            proxy base classes. See the Java documentation on dynamic_cast.

            Gerry Woods, and others.

09/23/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Some error checking added:
            1) OutOfMemoryException check in the char * typemaps. 
            2) As SWIG treats pointers, references and passing by value all the
            same, it is possible to pass a NULL pointer to a function that expects
            an object passed by value or by reference. A NullPointerException is 
            now thrown under this scenario.

09/15/2002: beazley
            Deprecation of the "ignore" typemap.   The "ignore" typemap has
            been deprecated in favor of a generalization of the "in" typemap.
            To ignore an argument, use something like this instead:

                %typemap(in,numinputs=0) int *output (int temp) {
                     $1 = &temp;
                }

            This change fixes a number of subtle bugs related to the interaction
            of the "in" and "ignore" typemaps (which were supposed to be
            mutually exclusive).

            The use of the numinputs argument is reserved for future expansion.
            Currently, values >1 will generate an error.  However, future
            releases of SWIG may utilize that to support multi-input typemaps.

            %typemap(ignore) still works, but generates a warning message and is
            translated to %typemap(in,numinputs=0).

09/15/2002: beazley
            Fixed segmentation fault for unnamed structures.  For example:

               typedef struct {
               } *blah;


            Reported by Roger Gibson.
            Note: we might be able to generate wrappers in special cases.

09/13/2002: beazley
            Minor modification to generated wrapper functions.  Pointer arguments are now
            always set to an initial value of 0.   Simplifies typemap writing and cleanup
            code (since you can rely on zero-value initialization).   This also greatly
            reduces the need to ever write an "arginit" typemap.

09/12/2002: beazley
            Minor enhancement to smart-pointer support.  If operator->()
            is part of an ignored base class like this,

                 %ignore Bar;

                 class Foo {
                 public:
                     int blah();
                 };

                 class Bar {         /* Ignored */
                 public:
                     ...
                     Foo *operator->();
                     ...
                 };

                 class Spam : public Bar { };

            then methods from Foo are still available.  For example,

                 >>> s = Spam()
                 >>> s.blah()
                 0
                 >>>

             The only catch is that the operator->() itself is not available
             (since it wasn't wrapped).   Therefore, there won't be any
             __deref__() operation unless it is explicitly added to Spam
             (either using %extend or just placing operator->() in the
             definition of Spam).

09/09/2002: beazley
            Fixed nasty runtime type checking bug with subtypes and inheritance
            and templates. 

09/09/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Java exception classes for a method's throws clause can be generated by 
            specifying them in a comma separated list in the throws attribute in any one
            of the following typemaps: in, out, check, freearg, argout and throws. A classic
            example would be to convert C++ exceptions into a standard Java exception:

                %typemap(throws, throws="java.io.IOException") file_exception {
                    jclass excep = jenv->FindClass("java/io/IOException");
                    if (excep)
                        jenv->ThrowNew(excep, $1.what());
                    return $null; // or use SWIG_fail
                }

                class file_exception {...};
                void open(const char *filename) throw(file_exception);

            The Java method will then be declared with a throws clause:

                public static void open(String filename) throws java.io.IOException {...}

09/08/2002: mkoeppe
	  * [Guile] Improved the documentation system.  The arglist no
	    longer gets cluttered with type specification, making it
	    more readable.  (Also the ILISP function C-u M-x
	    `arglist-lisp' RET works better this way.)  The types of
	    arguments are explained in an extra sentence after the
	    arglist. 
	    
	    There are now two documentation-related typemap arguments:

	        %typemap(in, doc="$NAME is a vector of integers", 
			 arglist="$name")  int *VECTOR { ... }
			 
            The "arglist" texts of all arguments of a function make up
	    its arglist in the documentation.  The "doc" texts of all
	    arguments are collected to make a sentence that describes
	    the types of the arguments.  Reasonable defaults are
	    provided. 

	    As usual, $name is substituted by the name of the
	    argument. The new typemap variable $NAME is like $name,
	    but marked-up as a variable.  This means that it is
	    upper-cased; in TeXinfo mode ("-procdocformat texinfo") it
	    comes out as @var{name}. 
	    
	    The directives %values_as_list, %values_as_vector,
	    %multiple_values now also have an effect on the
	    documentation. (This is achieved via the new pragmas
	    return_nothing_doc, return_one_doc, return_multi_doc.)

	    Documentation has also improved for variables that are
	    wrapped as procedures-with-setters (command-line switch
	    "-emit-setters").

          * [Guile] Emit constants as _immutable_ variables.  (This
            was broken recently.)

09/07/2002: mkoeppe
	    [Guile] Updated the typemaps in list-vector.i.

09/07/2002: mkoeppe
	    Short-circuit the typechecks for overloaded functions.
	    (The changes in code generation are visible in the new
	    testcase "overload_complicated".)

09/06/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Solution for [ 596413 ]
            New typemap so that the Java proxy classes and type wrapper classes
            wrapper constructor modifier can be tailored by users. The default value is 
            protected. Normally SWIG generates a constructor like this which can only 
            be accessed within one package:

              protected Bar(long cPtr, boolean cMemoryOwn) {
              ...
              }
            
            If you are using SWIG across multiple packages or want to use this constructor
            anyway, it can now be accessed outside the package. To modify use for example:

              %typemap(javaptrconstructormodifiers) SWIGTYPE "public"

            to change to public for all proxy classes and similarly for all type wrapper classes:
            
              %typemap(javaptrconstructormodifiers) SWIGTYPE, SWIGTYPE *, SWIGTYPE &, SWIGTYPE [] "public"

09/06/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Added throws typemaps for the Java module. C++ exceptions get converted into
            java.lang.RuntimeException Java exceptions. 
            
            Warning: This may change from java.lang.Runtime exception in the future.

09/05/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Fix for variables declared as references.

09/05/2002: beazley
            Fixed [ 605162 ] Typemap local variables. Reported by Lyle Johnson.

09/05/2002: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] More updates to the Ruby module documentation, including
	    a new typemap example that demonstrates how to collect key-value
	    pairs from an argument list into a Hash.

09/05/2002: beazley
            Fixed bug with template expansion and constructors.

                template<class T> class Foo {
                public:
                    Foo<T>() { }
                };

            The extra <T> in the constructor was carried through in the
            name--causing runtime problems in generated modules.
            Reported by Jordi Arnabat Benedicto.
 
09/05/2002: mkoeppe
	    [Guile] Support overloading.

09/04/2002: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] Updated typemaps for long long and unsigned long long types
	    to use Ruby 1.7 support for these types when available.

09/04/2002: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] Added output typemaps for const reference to primitive
	    types.

09/04/2002: mkoeppe
	    [Guile] Fix pass-by-value typemaps.  Reported by Arno
	    Peters via Debian bugtracking (#156902), patch by Torsten
	    Landschoff <torsten@debian.org>.

09/03/2002: samjam (Sam Liddicott)
	    Better reference support.
	    Functions that want a void** can take a NULL by reference and
	    the void* will be made for you and then passed-by-reference

	    Also all integer-class native types can be passed by reference
	    where an int* or int& etc is needed

09/03/2002: beazley
            Changed the evaluation order of preprocessor macro arguments.
            Arguments are now expanded by the preprocessor *before* they
            are passed to macro expansion.  This fixes a subtle expansion
            bug reported by Anthony Heading.

09/03/2002: beazley
            Fixed the file include order (again, apparently). See 2/27/99.

09/02/2002: beazley
            [Perl] Better exception handling support.  Since Perl error handling
            relies on setjmp/longjmp, wrapper functions have been modified slightly
            to provide an extra block scope:

                XS(foo) {
                   char _swigmsg[SWIG_MAX_ERRMSG] = "";
                   const char *_swigerr = _swigmsg;
                   {
                      /* Normal wrapper function here */
                      ...
                      SWIG_croak("An error occurred\n");
                      ...
                      XSRETURN(argvi);      /* Successful return */
                      fail:
                        /* cleanup code */
                   }
                   croak(_swig_err);
                }

            The macro SWIG_croak(x) sets the value of _swigerr to x and
            executes a "goto fail".  The whole wrapper function is enclosed
            block scope to provide proper cleanup of C++ objects.  Since
            croak executes a longjmp(), there is no way to properly reclaim
            resources if this executes in the same scope as the wrapper
            function.

            The _swigmsg[] variable is normally unused, but can be used
            to store small error messages using sprintf or snprintf. It
            has a capacity of at least 256 bytes (SWIG_MAX_ERRMSG).
            
09/02/2002: beazley
            [Tcl] Added better support for exceptions.  Instead of returning TCL_ERROR,
            use the macro SWIG_fail to return with an error.  This ensures that
            arguments are properly cleaned up.  Exception specifiers are now
            handled by default.

09/02/2002: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] The type-checking system for the Ruby module has had a flaw
	    in that some types which should be considered equivalent
	    weren't. This bug was best demonstrated by the inherit_missing.i
	    test suite case, which defines a base class "Foo" that is
	    subclassed by "Bar". The "Foo" class isn't actually wrapped (i.e.
	    it's not directly accessible from Ruby) but we'd still like to be
	    able to pass "Bar" instances to functions expecting Foos and have
	    that work; it wasn't. The revised implementation (similar to that
	    used for some other language modules) adds a new instance variable
	    (__swigtype__) to each object that indicates its SWIG type;
	    that is, each "Bar" instance will now have a string instance
	    variable called "__swigtype__" whose value is "_p_Bar".

            Unless developers were taking advantage of this low-level
	    implementation detail, they shouldn't notice any compatibility
	    problems; nevertheless, I'm marking it as a "potential
	    incompatibility".

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

            [Ruby] Fixed SF Bug #603199.

08/08/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Added OUTPUT, INPUT and INOUT typemaps in typemaps.i for C++ 
            references.

08/27/2002: mkoeppe
	    [Guile] Fixed error in "lib_std_vector" testcase and
	    compiler warning in "lib_cdata" testcase.

08/27/2002: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] Added the "%mixin" directive, which allows the user to
	    specify a comma-separated list of module names to mix-in to a
	    class. So, for example, if you'd like to specify that Ruby's
	    Enumerable module should be mixed-in to your class Foo, you'd
	    write:
	    
	        %mixin Foo "Enumerable";
		
            or to specify that the modules Fee, Fie and Fo should be mixed
	    in to Foo:
	    
	        %mixin Foo "Fee,Fie,Fo";
		
	    *** NEW FEATURE ***

08/27/2002: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] Modified the %alias directive so that multiple aliases
	    can be specified for an instance method by using a comma-separated
	    list of aliases.

08/27/2002: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] Added "throw" typemaps for the Ruby module.

08/26/2002: beazley
            Two new command line options for printing dependencies.
            'swig -M' lists all file dependencies.  'swig -MM' lists
            dependencies, but excludes files in the SWIG library. 
            Example:

               % swig -M -python example.i
               example_wrap.cxx: \
                /u0/beazley/Projects/lib/swig1.3/swig.swg \
                /u0/beazley/Projects/lib/swig1.3/python/python.swg \
                example.i \
                example.h 

               % swig -MM -python example.i
               example_wrap.cxx: \
                example.i \
                example.h

08/24/2002: beazley
            Automatic C++ exception handling enabled for all language modules.    This is
            pretty simple.  If you have a class like this:

                class Foo {
                };
                class Bar {
                public:
                    void blah() throw(Foo);
                }

            then the generated wrapper code looks like this:

                  wrap_Bar_blah() {
                       ...
                       try {
                           arg1->blah();
                       } 
                       catch (Foo &_e) {
                           /* "throw" typemap code inserted. $1 = _e */
                       }
                       catch (...) {
                          throw;
                       }
                  }
            The "throw" typemap can be used to raise an error in the target 
            language.  It can do anything.  Here is a very simple example:

                 %typemap("throw") Foo {
                     PyErr_SetString(PyExc_RuntimeError, "Foo exception");
                     return NULL;
                 }

            To make this work in each language module, simply define a few default
            "throw" typemaps for SWIGTYPE, SWIGTYPE *, int, const char *, and a
            few common exception types.   That's all there is to it.

            Automatic exception handling can be disabled using -noexcept or
            setting the NoExcept global variable to 1.
            *** NEW FEATURE ***

08/23/2002: beazley
            [ Python ]
            Automatic translation of C++ exception specifications into error handling code.
            For example:
 
                class Foo {
                };
                class Bar {
                public:
                    void blah() throw(Foo);
                }

            In this case, Foo is wrapped as a classic-style class (compatible
            with exception handling).  Furthermore, you can write Python code
            like this:

                b = Bar()
                try:
                    b.blah();
                except Foo,e:     # Note use of exception class here!
                    # Handle Foo error
                    ...

            The object "e" in the exception handler is just a wrapped Foo
            object.  Access it like a normal object.

            If an exception is not wrapped as a class, a RuntimeError
            exception is raised.  The argument to this exception is
            the exception object.  For example:
 
                class Bar {
                public:
                    void blah() throw(int);
                }

                b = Bar()
                try:
                   b.blah();
                except RuntimeError,e:
                   print e.args[0]       # Integer exception value

            Comments:

                -  If a class is used as an exception, it *must* be wrapped
                   as a Python classic-style class (new classes don't work).

                -  Automatic exception handling is compatible with %exception.

                -  Use -noexcept to turn off this feature.

                -  The newly introduced "throw" typemap is used to raise
                   Python errors (naturally).

            *** EXPERIMENTAL NEW FEATURE ***

08/23/2002: beazley
            Information from throw() specifiers is now stored in the parse
            tree.  For example:

                class Foo {
                public:
                     int blah() throw(spam,bar);
                }

            The stored information is fully corrected for namespaces and works
            with templates.  Uses will follow.
            
08/22/2002: beazley
            Exception handling code is no longer applied to member access
            function.  For example, in this code

                %exception {
                   try {
                      $action
                   } catch(whatever) {
                      ...
                   }
                }

                class Foo {
                public:
                    int x;
                    ...
                }

            The exception handling code is not applied to accessor functions
            for Foo::x.   This should reduce the amount of extra code
            generated.

            Caveat:  Exception handling code *is* used when attributes are
            accessed through a smart-pointer or a synthesized attributed
            added with %extend is used.

08/22/2002: beazley
            Made more patches to hopefully eliminate problems when compiling SWIG 
            as a 64-bit executable.

08/22/2002: beazley
            Fixed a bug with const reference members, variables, and static members.
            For example:

                  class Foo {
                  public:
                       static const int &ref;
                  };

            SWIG was trying to generate "set" functions which wouldn't compile. 

08/21/2002: beazley
            Made the warning message for "Class X might abstract" off by default.
            Enable with -Wall.

08/21/2002: beazley
            Refined handling of const and non-const overloaded methods.  If
            a class defines a method like this:

                class Foo {
                public:
                    int bar(int);
                    int bar(int) const;
                }

            Then the non-const method is *always* selected in overloading and
            the const method silently discarded.  If running with -Wall, a warning
            message will be generated.

08/19/2002: beazley
            Better support for using declarations and inheritance.   Consider this:

                class Foo {
                public:
                      int blah(int x);
                };

                class Bar {
                public:
                      double blah(double x);
                };

                class FooBar : public Foo, public Bar {
                public:
                      char *blah(char *x);
                      using Foo::blah;
                      using Bar::blah;
                };

            Now SWIG wraps FooBar::blah as an overloaded method that uses all
            accessible versions of blah().  See section 15.2.2 in Stroustrup, 3rd Ed.

            SWIG also supports access change through using declarations.  For example:

                class Foo {
                protected:
                     int x;
                     int blah(int x);
                };

                class Bar : public Foo {
                public:
                     using Foo::x;
                     using Foo::blah;
                };


            Caveat:   SWIG does not actually check to see if declarations imported
            via 'using' are in the inheritance hierarchy.  If this occurs, the
            wrapper code won't compile anyways---not sure it's worth worrying about.
          
08/18/2002: beazley
            Modified overloading dispatch to not include nodes with an "error" attribute.
            A language module can set this if a node couldn't be wrapped and you don't want
            it included in the dispatch function.

08/18/2002: beazley
            Enhancement to overloaded function dispatch.   The dispatcher is now aware of
            inheritance relationships.   For example:

                   class Foo { };
                   class Bar : public Foo { };
                    
                   void spam(Foo *f);
                   void spam(Bar *b);

            In this case, the dispatcher re-orders the functions so that spam(Bar *b) is
            checked first---it is more specific than spam(Foo *f).

08/17/2002: beazley
            Added -Werror command line option.   If supplied, warning messages are treated
            as errors and SWIG will return a non-zero exit code.

08/17/2002: beazley
            Fixed [ 596135 ] Typedef of reference can't compile.  For example:

                 typedef int &IntRef;
                 void foo(IntRef i);

            SWIG-1.3.14 generated code that wouldn't compile.

Version 1.3.14 (August 12, 2002)
================================

08/11/2002: mmatus
	    Static const members initialized during declaration, and
	    only them, ie:

	    struct A
	    {		 
		static const int a = 1 ;  // this one
		static const int b;       // not this one
            };     

	    are emitted like constants (equivalent to enums or
	    explicit %constant).
	    
	    This is because they cannot be added directly to 'cvar'
	    since they lack the needed reference (well, you can force
	    them to have a real reference, but in an ugly way which
	    goes completely again the original purpose of initialize
	    them during declaration, you also have to deal with extra
	    linking matters, and it take a while to figure out what is
	    the problem and how to solve it).
	    
	    Please test it with your preferred target language, and
	    not only the code generation, but really run the example
	    in the test-suite (static-const-member-2.i) because the
	    problem and the solution cannot be "fully" appreciated
	    until you try to load the module and run it.

	    In some target languages (python specially), this can
	    produces a difference in the way that the static constant
	    members 'a' and 'b' are internally wrapped. Hopefully,
	    they still can be accessed in the same way.


08/11/2002: mmatus
	    [python] Now static const members can be accessed in a more
	    natural way, ie, if you have

	    struct A
             {		 
		typedef unsigned int viewflags;
		static const viewflags forward_field = 0;
		static const viewflags backward_field;
            };     
	    
	    now you can do:

		print A.backward_field

	    and also

	        a = A()
		print a.forward_field
		
	    Note that if the static const members don't have an
	    initializer (like backward_field), still you can access
	    them in the same way in the python side, but the
	    implementation is a quite different: backward_field will
	    still appear in the cvar entity, and also, you are 
	    responsible to initialize it in some code unit, and link it
	    properly. forward_field, by the other hand, will not
	    appear in the cvar entity but only as a A member, similar
	    to what happen with enum or %constant members.

08/11/2002: mmatus
	    [python] Common code in the __setattr__/__getattr__ now
	    goes to two "free" methods at the beginning of the proxy
	    file, from where each class use it. This change reduces
	    the size of the proxy file, specially if you wrap a lot of
	    small classes in one module (up to 33% in some cases),
	    making it faster to load too.

            [Perl5] If a function that returns char * returns NULL,
            undef is returned to the Perl interpreter.
 
08/09/2002: beazley
            Fix to conversion operators and namespaces.  For example:

                namespace ns {
                    struct Foo { };
                    struct Bar {
                        operator Foo*();
                    };
                }

            In the wrapper code, SWIG was using ->operator Foo*()
            when it should have been using ->operator ns::Foo*().

            Note: if using %rename with a conversion operator, you
            might have to do this:

               %rename(toFooPtr) ns::operator ns::Foo*();
                                      //      ^^^^ note extra qualifier
               namespace ns {
                    ...

            
08/09/2002: beazley
            [Python] Minor enhancement to 'const' variable declarations. 
            Normally const declarations are wrapped as read-only variables
            accessible only through the cvar attribute (see SWIG.html for
            a discussion of why).  However, in many programs, "const" 
            declarations may just be constants---making the cvar. access
            awkward.  To fix this, "const" declarations are now available
            both through cvar. and as a simple name.  For example:

                 const int FOO = 42;

            In Python:

                 >>> print example.cvar.FOO
                 42
                 >>> print example.FOO
                 42

            Note: There are cases where the value of a "const" variable
            might change.  For example:

                 char *const BAR = "Hello World";

            In this case, the pointer itself can not change, but the 
            data being pointed to could be modified.  In these situations,
            cvar.BAR should be accessed to obtained the current value.

08/08/2002: beazley
            [Python] Fixed generation of the proxy code (.py files) to more
            closely follow the order of declarations as they appear in
            the .i file.   In the past, all of the class wrappers appeared
            first, followed by function stubs, inserted Python code, and
            other details.

08/08/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Proxy method _delete() changed to delete(). There shouldn't ever
            be a wrapped function called delete() as it is a C++ keyword and there
            is no such thing as a member function in C.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR JAVA MODULE ***

            Backwards compatibility can be achieved by adding the function back in
            for all proxy classes:
            %typemap(javacode) SWIGTYPE %{
              public void _delete() {
                delete();
              }
            %}

            Java backwards compatibility summary
            ------------------------------------

            There are a number of changes that have been made in improving the Java module 
            for ver 1.3.14.  If at all possible change your code to take advantages of the 
            improvements. If you were using proxy classes you may not notice any backwards 
            compatibility issues. Here is an example which will help with most backwards 
            compatibility problems where it is not possible to modify the code that uses
            the generated output:

            Replace:
                %module modulename

            With:
                %module (jniclassname="modulename") modulename;
                %typemap(javacode) SWIGTYPE %{
                    public long getCPtr$javaclassname() {
                        return swigCPtr;
                    }
                    public void _delete() {
                      delete();
                    }
                %}
                %pragma(java) jniclassclassmodifiers="public";

            The proxy constructors that took parameters (long cPtr, boolean cMemoryOwn)
            were public and are now protected. If you were making use of these then you'll 
            have to modify your code and the best solution would be to use the new type 
            wrapper classes.

            The other main areas are the pragmas and global variable wrapping. Replace 
            the pragmas with one of the new directives or typemaps mentioned below and use
            %rename on the variables.

            If you were not using proxy classes, you will have to define a jstype typemap
            as well as a jtype typemap.

            [Java] Fix for wrapping two dimension array variables.

08/07/2002: beazley
            [Python,Tcl]
            Object management now has a much better sense of ownership.
            Ownership bits is changed whenever an object is stored in a
            global variable or structure member.  For example:

                struct Foo {
                    int val;
                    Foo *next;
                };

            Now in Python

               >>> f = Foo()
               >>> f.thisown
               1
               >>> g = Foo()
               >>> g.next = f          # Assign a pointer
               >>> f.thisown           # Notice ownership change
               0
               >>>

            This scheme is mostly a conservative heuristic designed to 
            provide segmentation faults.  It could cause a memory leak
            if ownership is changed unnecessarily.  In this case, you can
            either write a typemap (that doesn't change ownership), or
            manually set the thisown attribute back to 1.

08/07/2002: beazley
            [Tcl] Major usability improvements to the object interface.
            Suppose you had code like this:

                 struct Foo { 
                     int x;
                     int spam();
                 };

                 void  blah(Foo *f);

            In past versions of SWIG, you could create objects and use
            them like this:

                % Foo f
                % f configure -x 3
                % f spam
                37
    
            The only problem is that if you tried to call blah(), it didn't
            work:

                % blah f
                Type Error. Expected _p_Foo
                %

            Instead, you had to do this:

                % blah [f cget -this]
  
            SWIG now automatically extracts the -this pointer, avoiding this
            problem.  This means that saying "blah f" is perfectly legal and
            everything will still work normally.

            Caveat: Since pointer strings start with a leading underscore (_),
            don't use this in object names.  For example:

                % Foo _f 
                % blah _f        # Potential crash

            Objects now have a -thisown attribute that shows the ownership.
            This builds upon the CHANGES 11/24/2001 entry.

            Upgraded mzscheme module to support version 201 and added
            overloading support.

08/05/2002: beazley
            Added parsing support for extra grouping (in very limited cases).
            For example:

                    typedef int (FuncPtr)(int, double);

08/03/2002: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] Updates to typemaps.i as those done previously for Perl,
            Python and Tcl modules. Now supports reference types with INPUT,
            OUTPUT and INOUT typemaps.

08/02/2002: beazley
            New library file cstring.i added.  Provides macros for
            manipulating char * data.
 
08/02/2002: beazley
            Deprecated the %new directive.  Use %newobject instead.  For
            example:

               %newobject foo;
               ...
               char *foo();

            %newobject follows the same rules as %rename, %ignore, %feature,
            etc.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

08/01/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] New attribute 'jniclassname' for the module directive allows a way of
            changing the JNI class name from the default which uses the modulename with JNI
            appended after it.

                %module (jniclassname="name") modulename

            If 'name' is the same as 'modulename' then the module class name gets changed
            from 'modulename' to modulenameModule.

08/01/2002: beazley
            Fixed problem with file include order.  Language specific
            directories should take precedence over generic directories.
            For example:  "swig_lib/python/foo.i" should be loaded before
            "swig_lib/foo.i".    I thought this was the case already, but
            apparently it has been broken for quite some time.

08/01/2002: beazley
            Added std_deque.i library file.  Work in progress.

08/01/2002: beazley
            [Python,Tcl,Perl]
            Improvements to typemaps.i.  INPUT/INOUT typemaps perform better
            error checking.  Typemaps are now supplied for references like 
            int &OUTPUT, double &INOUT, etc.
          
08/01/2002: beazley
            [Python] Deprecated the T_* and L_* typemaps in typemaps.i.
            Multiple return values are always placed in a tuple. Deprecated
            the BOTH typemaps.  This is now INOUT (e.g., int *INOUT).

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR PYTHON MODULE ***

08/01/2002: beazley
            Deprecated the array.i, carray.i, and timer.i library files.

08/01/2002: beazley
            Deprecated the pointer.i library file.  Use cpointer.i instead.

08/01/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] For consistency the global variable getters and setters use the JavaBean 
            property design pattern like member variables always have. This means if you are 
            wrapping a variable called foo, the getter is called getFoo() and the setter is 
            called setFoo(). Before the recent changes to the Java module the getters and 
            setters were called get_foo() and set_foo(). If you really want the original 
            function names use the %rename directive like this: %rename(_foo) Foo;

07/31/2002: beazley
            Fixed casting problem with multiple inheritance.  If you had this,

                  class foo {};
                  class bar : public foo {};
                  class baz : public foo {};
                  class spam : public bar, public baz {};

            then the wrappers wouldn't compile due to an ambiguous cast.
            Reported by Art Yerkes.

07/30/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Due to new static typechecking all pointers held in a Java long are part of 
            the internal workings and this pointer value in the Java long has become abstracted
            data. The type wrapper constructor and getCPtr() methods are as such protected.
            If you need to mess around with pointers from Java or for example create a proxy 
            class or type wrapper class around a null pointer, add a function/constructor 
            to do so with the %javacode typemap. You can also make getCPtr() public again with
            the %javagetcptr typemap.

07/30/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Fixes for %typemap(ignore). In particular when ignoring the last parameter
            in a function. Also for all parameters in constructors. These mods have also fixed
            multi-argument typemaps for proxy classes - SF 581791.

07/30/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] %newobject (replacement for %new) now implemented for Java. 

07/29/2002: beazley
            Fixed problem with typemap copies, %apply, and %clear inside
            C++ namespaces.

07/28/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] The JNI class now has package access as the class modifier
            has been changed from "public" to nothing. This has been done
            as this class is now more for the internal workings of SWIG since the module
            class has static type checking for all types.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR JAVA MODULE ***

            Backwards compatibility can be achieved by using the %jniclassclassmodifier 
            pragma to change it back to "public".

07/28/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Proxy/Shadow classes are generated by default. The -proxy and 
            -shadow command line options are deprecated. If you want to use the 
            low-level functional interface then use the new -noproxy commandline option.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR JAVA MODULE ***

07/28/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Remaining pragmas shakeup. These were the remaining pragmas and their
            new names where changed:

            modulebase
            modulecode
            moduleclassmodifiers
            moduleimport => moduleimports
            moduleinterface => moduleinterfaces

            The moduleimports works slightly differently to how the moduleimport pragma worked. 
            Now it actually takes code which gets placed before the class definition so the 
            whole import statement has to be given, for example:

            %pragma(java) moduleimports=%{
            import java.io.*;
            import java.math.*;
            %}

            The moduleinterfaces is slightly different to the old moduleinterface in that if 
            more than one interface is required they must be comma separated in one use of 
            the pragma, for example:

            %pragma(java) moduleinterfaces="Serializable, MyInterface"

            These last two pragmas are consistent with the javainterfaces and javaimports 
            typemap.

            A similar set of pragmas has been introduced, namely:

            jniclassbase
            jniclasscode
            jniclassclassmodifiers
            jniclassimport
            jniclassinterface

            These work in the same way as their module counterparts. Note that previously
            the moduleXXX pragmas worked on the old module class which is now called the
            JNI class (the class with the native functions). The jniclassXXX pragmas now 
            work on the new module class (the class that has all the global functions and
            global variable getters and setters when using proxy classes, plus all other
            remaining functions when using the low-level procedural interface).

            In summary the contents of the pragmas make up a class like this:

            <jniclassimports>
            <jniclassmodifiers> class modulename extends <jniclassbase> implements <jniclassinterfaces> {
                <jniclasscode>
                ... SWIG generated functions ...
            }
}

            [Java] Deprecated modulemethodmodifiers pragma and replaced with 
            a better %feature based directive called %javamethodmodifiers.
            A useful example would be for synchronisation in multi-threaded apps:

            %javamethodmodifiers foo(int a) "public synchronized";

            Changes this function from the default ("public") to "public synchronized".

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR JAVA MODULE ***

07/26/2002: beazley
            Several directives now allow optional configuration parameters.
            These include:

                %module(name="value", name="value", ...) modulename
                %import(name="value", ...) "filename.i"
                %extend(name="value", ...) classname {
                   ...
                }

            These currently have no effect and are reserved for
            future expansion.
               
07/26/2002: beazley
            Enhancements to smart-pointer handling.  SWIG only provides
            extra support for a smart-pointer if operator->() returns
            a proper pointer.  For example:

                 Foo *operator->();

            If operator->() returns an object by value or reference,
            then SWIG examines the returned object to see if it also
            implements operator->().  If so, SWIG chases operator->()
            until it can find one that returns a pointer.  This allows
            cases like this to work:

                 class Foo {
                 public:
                     void blah();
                 };

                 class Bar {
                   ...
                   Foo *operator->();
                   ...
                 };

                 class Spam {
                   ...
                   Bar operator->();
                   ...
                 };

            For example:

                 >>> s = Spam()
                 >>> s.blah()      # Invokes Foo::blah()

            The s.blah() call actually invokes:

                  ((s.operator->()).operator->())->blah();
 
07/26/2002: beazley
            Fixed a bug with typedef and references.  For example:

                 typedef Foo & FooRef;
                 FooRef blah();

            Previous versions of SWIG generated code that wouldn't
            compile.

07/25/2002: beazley
            Wrapping of static methods has been improved in proxy classes.  In older
            versions of SWIG, if you had this:

                  class Foo {
                  public:
                     static void bar();
                  };

            The static method was only available as a function Foo_bar().  For example:

                  >>> Foo_bar()

            Now, the static method can also be invoked through an instance like this:

                  >>> f = Foo()
                  >>> f.bar()        # Invokes static method

            This works with all versions of Python.  Additionally, for Python-2.2,
            the static method can be invoked as:

                  >>> Foo.bar()

            The old-style function is still support for backwards compatibility. If
            you care about making your code across different versions of Python,
            either use Foo_bar() or access the method through an instance.
 
07/25/2002: beazley
            Changes to the Python module.  Proxy classes now utilize new Python-2.2
            features including properties and static methods.  However, these features
            are supported in a way that provides backwards compatibility with older
            Python versions.  In other words, proxy classes work with all versions
            of Python and only use new features when running on Python-2.2.


07/25/2002: beazley
            Modified %extend so that overloaded methods can be added.  For example:

                %extend Foo {
                     void bar(int x) { };
                     void bar(char *s) { };
                     ...
                }

            This works with both C++ *and* C.

07/24/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] More new typemaps so that the Java proxy classes and type wrapper classes
            can be further tailored by users. These are the default code for generating the 
            finalize() methods (proxy classes only) and the getCPtr() methods for proxy 
            classes and type wrapper classes:

            %typemap(javafinalize) SWIGTYPE %{
              protected void finalize() {
                _delete();
              }
            %}
            
            %typemap(javagetcptr) SWIGTYPE, SWIGTYPE *, SWIGTYPE &, SWIGTYPE [] %{
              public static long getCPtr($javaclassname obj) {
                return obj.swigCPtr;
              }
            %}

            The javagetcptr typemap will enable users to handle Java null by overriding
            this typemap - a requested feature.

            The -nofinalize commandline option has been deprecated. The javafinalize
            typemap is more powerful as it will allow the removal of the finalize methods 
            for all or any one or more particular proxy class.

07/23/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] The getCPtrXXX() function has been changed to a static function and
            is now of the form:

            protected static long getCPtr(XXX obj) {...}

            This is a requested change which will allow Java null pointers to be used as null
            can be passed in for obj. However, to achieve this the appropriate code must be
            written using the new javagetcptr typemap directive.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR JAVA MODULE ***

            Backwards compatibility can be achieved by adding this function back in using the
            new javacode typemap:

            %typemap(javacode) SWIGTYPE %{

              // SWIG-1.3.12 and SWIG-1.3.13
              public long getCPtr$javaclassname() {
                return swigCPtr;
              }
              // SWIG-1.3.11 and earlier
              public long getCPtr() {
                return swigCPtr;
              }

            %}


07/23/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] New directive to control constant code generation - %javaconst.
            The default handling for handling constants is to get the value through
            a JNI call, eg

            #define YELLOW 5
            #define BIG 1234LL

            results in:

            public final static int YELLOW = modulename.get_YELLOW();
            public final static long BIG = modulename.get_BIG();

            Earlier versions of the Java module initialised the value using the C value:

            public final static int YELLOW = 5;
            public final static long BIG = 1234LL;

            This works in most cases, but the value for BIG won't compile as 1234LL is not
            valid Java code and this is one of the reasons why the default is now to get the 
            values through a JNI call. The side effect is that these 'constants' cannot be used 
            in switch statements. The %javaconst directive allows one to specify the
            way the constant value is initialised and works like other %feature
            directives, eg

            %javaconst(0);     // all constants from this point on are initialised using the C value
            %javaconst(1) BIG; // just BIG initialised using JNI call (must be parsed before BIG is defined)

07/23/2002: beazley
            *** IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE PYTHON MODULE ***

            (1) The Python module now enables shadow/proxy classes by default.
            This means that two files are always created by SWIG.  For
            instance, if you have this:

                 // file: foo.i
                 %module foo
                 ...

            Then swig generates two files "foo_wrap.c" and "foo.py".

            (2) The name of the low-level C extension module has been changed
            to start with a leading underscore.   This means that you have
            to compile the module as follows:

                $ cc -c -I/usr/local/include/python2.2 foo_wrap.c
                $ cc -shared foo_wrap.o $(OBJS) -o _foo.so
                                                   ^^^^
                                                   note extra underscore

            This naming scheme is consistent with other Python modules that
            utilize extension code.  For instance, the socket module consists
            of "_socket.so" and "socket.py".  In previous versions of SWIG,
            the shared object file was named "foocmodule.so".

            (3) A new directive can be used to insert Python code into
            the corresponding .py file.  For example:

                %pythoncode %{
                def foo():
                    print "Hello World"
                %}

             This directive allows you to create modules as a mix of C and Python.
             Python code is seamlessly added to the module.

            (4) The -shadow command line option is deprecated.  This is turned on
            by default.

            (5) To disable the generation of the extra python file, use the "-noproxy"
            command line option.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
            This change will likely break the build environment of projects that
            utilize shadow classes.   To fix this, you probably only need to
            change the name of the target .so file.  For example, if you have
            Makefile information like this:

                   TARGET = examplecmodule.so

            Just change it to:

                   TARGET = _example.so

            *** DOCUMENTATION UPDATE ***
            The file Doc/Manual/Python.html has been updated to describe these changes.


07/23/2002: beazley
            Added -noextern option.   If supplied, SWIG will not generate
            extra extern declarations.  This is sometimes an issue on 
            non-unix platforms.

07/23/2002: beazley
            Added a warning for ignored friend functions.

07/23/2002: beazley
            Fixed [ 574498 ] -proxy and %include "pointer.i" clash.
            Reported by David Creasy.

07/23/2002: beazley
            Fixed [ 576103 ] global destruction warning with shadow.
            Perl extensions should no longer report the warning

               "Use of uninitialized value during global destruction."
 
            when running with "perl -w".  Reported by
            Brett Williams.

07/23/2002: beazley
            In C++ mode, SWIG now always defines namespace std.  By default,
            it's empty.  However, this will silence errors from programs
            that include statements such as "using namespace std;".
            This fixes Bug [ 584017 ] using namespace std generates error.
            Reported by Joseph Winston.

07/22/2002: beazley
            Added a new warning message for %apply.  If you use %apply but no typemaps
            are defined, you will get a warning message.  This should help with
            problems like this:

                   %apply char *OUTPUT { ... };

            In old versions of SWIG, this silently did nothing.  Now you get an error like this:
  
                   file:line. Warning. Can't apply (char *OUTPUT). No typemaps are defined.

07/22/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Started Java pragma deprecation. Replacements use %typemap based 
            directives and enable proxy classes and the new type wrapper classes to be 
            tailored in various ways. These are the new typemaps:
            
            %typemap(javabase)           - base (extends) for Java class
            %typemap(javaclassmodifiers) - class modifiers for the Java class: default is "public"
            %typemap(javacode)           - java code is copied verbatim to the Java class
            %typemap(javaimports)        - import statements for Java class
            %typemap(javainterfaces)     - interfaces (extends) for Java class
            
            And these are the %pragma directives being deprecated:
            allshadowbase
            allshadowclassmodifiers
            allshadowcode
            allshadowimport
            allshadowinterface
            shadowbase
            shadowclassmodifiers
            shadowcode
            shadowimport
            shadowinterface
            
            Note that it is possible to target a particular proxy class:
            %typemap(javaimports) Foo "import java.util.*";
            or a particular type wrapper class:
            %typemap(javaimports) double* "import java.math.*";
            Note that $javaclassname in these typemaps are substituted with either the proxy 
            classname when using proxy classes or the SWIGTYPE class name.

07/18/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Java module overhaul to implement static type checking of all 
            types. 
            
            1) Changes when using Java Proxy classes
            ----------------------------------------

            Previously when wrapping global functions: 

            class SomeClass{};
            void foo(SomeClass* s);
            SomeClass* bar();

            The native method prototypes used a long for pointers and looked like this:

            public class modulename  {
                ...
                public final static native void foo(long jarg1);
                public final static native long bar();
            }

            and unlike member functions of a C++ class there was no wrapper around the native calls 
            to make the use of them more user friendly. They would be used from Java like this:

            SomeClass s = new SomeClass(modulename.bar(), false);
            modulename.foo(s.getCPtrSomeClass());

            Note that the following will have the same effect, but then it would not have 
            been possible to call any proxy member functions in SomeClass:

            long s = modulename.bar();
            modulename.foo(s);

            Now wrapper functions are generated:

            public class modulename  {
                public static void foo(SomeClass s) {
                    // calls the native function
                }

                public static SomeClass bar() {
                    // calls the native function
                }
            }

            Which means these functions can now be used more naturally with proxy classes:

            SomeClass s = modulename.bar();
            modulename.foo(s);

            2) Changes when not using Java Proxy classes
            --------------------------------------------

            The so called low-level interface was rather low-level indeed. The 
            new static type checking implementation makes it less so but it remains a
            functional interface to the C/C++ world. Proxy classes are the obvious way to use
            SWIG generated code, but for those who want a functional interface all non-primitive
            types now have a simple Java class wrapper around the C/C++ type. Pointers and
            references to primitive types are also wrapped by type wrapper classes. The type
            wrapper classnames are based on the SWIG descriptors used by the other language 
            modules. For example:

            C/C++ type      Java type wrapper class name
            ----------      ----------------------------
            int*            SWIGTYPE_p_int
            double**        SWIGTYPE_p_p_double
            SomeClass*      SWIGTYPE_p_SomeClass
            SomeClass&      SWIGTYPE_p_SomeClass
            SomeClass       SWIGTYPE_p_SomeClass

            Note that everything wrapped by SWIG is accessed via a pointer even when wrapping 
            functions that pass by value or reference. So the previous example would now be 
            used like this:

            SWIGTYPE_p_SomeClass s = example.bar();
            example.foo(s);

            Note that typedefs that SWIG knows about are resolved, so that if one has 

            class Foo{};
            typedef Foo Bar;

            then any use of Bar will require one to use SWIGTYPE_p_Foo;

            Some considerations:
            Make sure you make a firm decision to use either proxy classes or the functional 
            interface early on as the classnames are different.

            3) Pointers and non-parsed types
            --------------------------------
            Sometimes SWIG cannot generate a proxy class. This occurs when the definition of 
            a type is not parsed by SWIG, but is then used as a variable or a parameter. 
            For example,

            void foo(Snazzy sds);

            If SWIG has not parsed Snazzy it handles it simply as a pointer to a Snazzy.
            The Java module gives it a type wrapper class around the pointer and calls it 
            SWIGTYPE_p_Snazzy. In other words it handles it in the same manner as types are 
            handled in the low-level functional interface. This approach is used for all 
            non-proxy classes, eg all pointer to pointers and pointers to primitive types.

            4) Backwards compatibility
            -----------------------
            Backwards compatibility is not an issue if you have been using proxy classes and 
            no global variables/functions. Otherwise some changes will have to be made. 
            The native methods still exist but they are now in a JNI class, which is called 
            modulenameJNI. As this class is really part of the internal workings,
            it should not be required so the class has become protected. Some pragmas/directives
            will hopefully be added to help with backwards compatibility.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR JAVA MODULE ***

07/18/2002: beazley
            Modified wrapping of uninstantiated templates returned by
            value.  Just to be safe, they are now wrapped by SwigValueWrapper<>
            just in case they don't define a default constructor.  This
            would be used if you had code like this

                 Foo<int> blah();
                 void     moreblah(Foo<int> x);

            but you didn't instantiate Foo<int> using %template.  
            We should probably add a warning for this.

07/17/2002: beazley
            Added an error check to detect shadowed template paramaters.
            For example:

                  template<class T> class Foo {
                  public:
                        int T;
                  };

            This results in an error, not a warning.  This warning is
            also needed to fix some rather insidious problems like
            this:

                 struct T {
                      int  blah;
                 };

                 template<class T> class Foo {
                 public:
                      typedef T Traits;    // Which T is this????
                 };

            In this case, the template parameter T shadows the outer
            structure (which is what you want).

07/16/2002: beazley
            Improved support for templates with integer arguments.  SWIG is
            much more aware of situations such as this:

                const int Size = 100;

                %template(Foo100) Foo<100>;
                void bar(Foo<Size> *x);   // Knows that Foo<Size> is the same as Foo<100>;

07/15/2002: beazley
            Fixed bug with %feature/%ignore/%rename and namespaces.
            For example:

                %ignore Foo::Bar
                namespace Foo {
                     class Bar {
                     ...
                     };
                }

            Reported by Marcelo Matus.

07/09/2002: beazley
            Added parsing support for constructors that try to catch
            exceptions in initializers.   For example:

              class Foo {
                 Bar b;
              public:
                 Foo(int x) try 
                     : b(x) { ... }
                 catch(int) {
                     ...
                 }
              }

            This has no effect on the generated wrappers.  However, the try and catch
            parts of the declaration are ignored.  See Stroustrup, 3rd Ed, section 
            14.4.6.1 for details.
                   
07/06/2002: beazley
            Fixed bug in template symbol table management.  This fixes
            two bugs.  First, mixing abstract methods, templates, and 
            inheritance no longer generates a failed assertion.
 
                template <class T>
                class A {
                public:
                   virtual void foo() = 0;
                };
 
               template <class T>
               class B : public A<T>
               {
               };
               %template(A_int) A<int>;
               %template(B_int) B<int>;

            This fix also fixes a subtle problem with default values and
            templates.  For example:

               template <class C>
               struct B {
                   typedef unsigned int size_type;
                   static const size_type nindex = static_cast<size_type>(-1);
                   void foo(size_type index = nindex);
               };

            [Ruby] Changed the definition of the SWIG_ConvertPtr() function
	    for the SWIG/Ruby runtime support so that it looks like the
	    Python version. If the last argument (flags) is non-zero,
	    SWIG_ConvertPtr() will raise an exception for type mismatches
	    as before. If flags is zero, this function will return -1 for

            Overloaded functions/methods/constructors now work in many language
            modules.  The support is completely transparent--just call the
            function normally and SWIG will dispatch to the correct implementation.
            There are a variety of issues associated with this.  Please refer
            to the overloading section of Doc/Manual/SWIGPlus.html for details.
            *** NEW FEATURE ***
            
07/04/2002: beazley
            Fixed a bug with namespaces, enums, and templates.  For example:

               namespace hello {
                  enum Hello { Hi, Hola };
 
                  template <Hello H>
                      struct traits
                      {
                          typedef double value_type;
                      };
 
                 traits<Hi>::value_type say_hi()
                 {
                    return traits<Hi>::value_type(1);
                 }
               }
            SWIG wasn't generating wrappers that properly qualified 
            traits<Hi>.  Reported by Marcelo Matus.         

06/30/2002: beazley
            Supplied array variable typemaps for Tcl module.   If you have a
            variable like this:

                int foo[10];

            then a set function like this is generated:

                void foo_set(int *x) {
                   memmove(foo,x,10*sizeof(int));
                }

06/30/2002: beazley
            New %fragment directive.   When writing typemaps, it can be easy to
            get carried away and write a lot of code.  However, doing so causes
            tremendous code bloat.   A common way to solve this is to write 
            helper functions.  For example:

                %{
                void some_helper_function() {
                     ...
                }
                %}

                %typemap(in) type {
                   some_helper_function(...);
                }

            The only problem with this is that the wrapper file gets polluted
            with helper functions even if they aren't used.    To fix this,
            a new fragment directive is available.  For example:

               (corrected typo in line below - 06/26/2008)
               %fragment("type_header","header") %{
                  void some_helper_function() {
                      ...
                  }
               %}

               %typemap(in, fragment="type_header") type {
                   some_helper_function(...);
               }

            In this case, the code fragment is only emitted if the typemap is
            actually used.   A similar capability is provided for declaration
            annotation and the %feature directive.  For example:

               %feature("fragment","type_header")  SomeDeclaration;

            The first argument to %fragment is the fragment name.  The second argument
            is the file section where the fragment should be emitted.  

            The primary use of this directive is for writers of language modules
            and advanced users wanting to streamline typemap code.

            *** EXPERIMENTAL NEW FEATURE ***

06/30/2002: beazley
            Supplied memberin typemaps for all arrays in an attempt to eliminate
            confusion about their use.

06/29/2002: beazley
            Experimental support for smart-pointers.  When a class defines
            operator->() like this

               class Foo {
                  ...
                  Bar *operator->();
                  ...
               };

            SWIG locates class Bar and tries to wrap its member variables and
            methods as part of Foo.  For example, if Bar was defined like this:

               class Bar {
               public:
                    int x;
                    int spam();
               };

            You could do this (in the target language):

              f = Foo()
              f.x = 4            # Accesses Bar::x
              f.spam()           # Accesses Bar::spam

            The primary use of this feature is to emulate the behavior of C++
            smart-pointers---which allow attributes to accessed transparently
            through operator->.

            This feature is supported automatically in SWIG---no special directives
            are needed.   To disable this behavior.  Use %ignore to ignore 
            operator->.
            *** NEW FEATURE ***

06/26/2002: beazley
            Deprecated the %except directive.   %exception should be used instead.

06/25/2002: beazley
            Major cleanup of the modules directory.  Eliminated most
            header files, consolidated module code into single files.

06/24/2002: beazley
            Reworked the instantiation of language modules.  All language
            modules must now define a factory function similar to this:

                extern "C" Language *
                swig_python(void) {
                   return new PYTHON();
                }

            This function is then placed in a table and associated with
            a command line option in swigmain.cxx.  

            This approach has a number of benefits.  It decouples the 
            SWIG main program from having to know about the class
            definitions for each module.  Also, by using a factory
            function, it will be easier to implement dynamic loading
            of modules (simply load the file and invoke the factory
            function).

06/24/2002: beazley
            Fixed syntax error for reference conversions.  For example:

                     operator Foo &();

Version 1.3.13 (June 17, 2002)
==============================

06/16/2002: beazley
            Fixed a bug with __FILE__ expansion in the preprocessor.   On Windows,
            the backslash (\) is now converted to (\\) in the string literal
            used for __FILE__.  Reported by Steve Glaser.

06/14/2002: beazley
            Fixed warning message about 'name private in this context'.  The
            warning is only generated for public methods.  Reported by
            Scott Michel.
 
06/14/2002: beazley
            Fixed some problems related to template instantiation 
            and namespaces.   When SWIG expands a template, it does
            so with fully resolved types.  For example, if you have this:

                template<class T> class foo { };
                typedef double Double;
                %template(foo_d) foo<Double>;

            then, it is handled as foo<double> in the typesystem.
            This fixes a number of subtle problems with inheritance
            and templates.

06/10/2002: beazley
            Modified %template to allow for empty instantiations.

                  %template() foo<int,int>;

            This registers foo<int,int> with the type system, but
            doesn't wrap it (same as %ignore).   This may only be a
            temporary measure.   SWIG might be able to automatically
            instantiate templates in certain cases.

06/10/2002: beazley
            Fixed function prototype problems with Tcl 8.4

06/09/2002: beazley
            Fixed problem with templates and location of base classes.  
            This one is a little mind-bending, but here is an example
            that illustrates:
 
             template <class ArgType, class ResType>
             struct traits
             {
                  typedef ArgType arg_type;
                  typedef ResType res_type;
             };
 
             template <class ArgType, class ResType>
             struct Function
             {
             };
 
             template <class AF, class AG>
             struct Class : Function<typename traits<AF, AG>::arg_type,
                                     typename traits<AF, AG>::res_type>
             {
             };

             %template(traits_dd) traits <double, double>;
             %template(Function_dd) Function <double, double>;
             %template(Class_dd) Class <double, double>;


            In this example, the base class of 'Class' is determined from
            the Function template, but the types are obtained through typedefs.
            Because of this, SWIG could not locate the wrapped base class
            (Function<double,double>).   Should be fixed in 1.3.13 even
            though I can think of a million other things that might
            also be broken.

06/07/2002: beazley
            Fixed a problem with conversion operators.  If you had an
            operator like this,

                  operator double() const;

            SWIG was ommitting the "const" qualifier.  This affected
            %rename and other directives.  Reported by Zhong Ren.

06/07/2002: beazley
            Lessened the strictness of abstract class checking.  If
            you have code like this:

                class Foo {
                public:
                   virtual int method() = 0;
                };

                class Bar : public Foo {
                public:
                    Bar();
                   ~Bar();
                };

             SWIG will go ahead and generate constructor/destructors
             for Bar.  However, it will also generate a warning message 
             that "Bar" might be abstract (since method() isn't defined).
             In SWIG-1.3.12, SWIG refused to generate a constructor at all.

06/07/2002: beazley
            Change to %template directive.  If you specify something like this:

                %template(vi) std::vector<int>;

            It is *exactly* the same as this:
 
                namespace std {
                    %template(vi) vector<int>;
                }

            SWIG-1.3.12 tried to instantiate the template outside of the namespace
            using some trick.  However, this was extremely problematic and full
            holes.   This version is safer.

06/07/2002: beazley
            Fixed bug with scope qualification and templates.  For example:

                 A<B::C>::DD

            Before, this was separated as scopes A<B, C>, and DD.  Fixed now.

06/06/2002: beazley
            Allow the following syntax: 
               
               class A { };
               struct B : A { ... };

            A base class without a specifier is assumed to be public for a struct.

            Reported by Marcelo Matus.

06/05/2002: beazley
            Fixed subtle problems with %rename directive and template
            expansion.

            Code like this should now work:

               %rename(blah) foo<double>::method;
               ...
               template<class T> class foo {
               public:
                   void method();
               };

               %template(whatever) foo<double>;

06/05/2002: beazley
            Resolved some tricky issues of multi-pass compilation and 
            and inheritance.  The following situation now generates
            an error:

                  class Foo : public Bar {
                  ...
                  };

                  class Bar {
                  ...
                  };

            The following code generates a warning about incomplete classes.

                  class Bar;
                  class Foo : public Bar { };

            The following code generates a warning about an undefined class.

                  class Foo : public Bar { };  // Bar undefined

            This fixes a failed assertion bug reported by Jason Stewart.

06/05/2002: ljohnson
            [Ruby] Added a warning message for the Ruby module about the lack
            of support for multiple inheritance. Only the first base class
            listed is used and the others are ignored. (Reported by Craig
            Files).
            
06/03/2002: beazley
            Fixed a bug with struct declarations and typedef. For example:

                 typedef struct Foo Foo;
                 struct Foo {
                    ...
                 };

            A few other subtle struct related typing problems were
            also resolved.

Version 1.3.12 (June 2, 2002)
=============================
            
05/30/2002: beazley
            Fixed problem related to forward template class declarations and
            namespaces.  Bug reported by Marcelo Matus.

05/30/2002: beazley
            Added 'make uninstall' target.  Contributed by Joel Reed.

05/29/2002: beazley
            Fixed rather insidious bug with %rename, %feature and template specialization.
            For example:

                %exception vector::__getitem__ {
                     ... some exception ...
                }

                template<class T> class vector {
                    ...
                    T __getitem__(int index);       // Fine
                    ...
                };

                template<> class vector<int> {
                    ...
                    T __getitem__(int index);       // Oops.
                    ...
                };

            Now, the %exception directive (and other features) should correctly apply to
            both vector and specializations.

05/29/2002: beazley
            Subtle changes to %template() directive.   Template arguments are now
            reduced to primitive types in template matching.  For example:

               template<class T> class vector<T *> {
                ... partial specialization ...
               }

               typedef int *IntPtr;     // Gross typedef

               // Gets the above partial specialization
               %template(vectorIntPtr) vector<IntPtr>;

            This change is extremely subtle, but it fixes a number of potential
            holes in Luigi's STL library modules.    For example:

                typedef int Integer;
                %template(vectori) vector<int>;

05/29/2002: beazley
            Fixed rather insidious typemap bug related to const.  const
            was being discarded through typedefs.

05/29/2002: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] Added input typemaps for const references to primitive
            types (in Lib/ruby/ruby.swg).

05/29/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] The java arrray support functions are enclosed by 
            a SWIG_NOARRAYS #define. Useful if not using arrays and 
            it is desirable to minimise the amount of compiled code.

05/29/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Enums were not renamed when using %name or %rename
            fix.

05/28/2002: ljohnson
            [Ruby] Modified the name of the wrapper functions for the
	    "new" singleton method and "initialize" instance method for
	    consistency with the other language modules. The wrapper name
	    for the function that implements "new" is alloc_classname and
	    the wrapper name for the function that implements "initialize"
	    is new_classname.


05/27/2002: beazley
            Changes to runtime.  Pointer conversion/creation functions
            now almost always have an extra "flags" argument.  For
            example:

              SWIG_ConvertPtr(obj, void **, swig_type_info *ty, int flags);
                                                                ^^^^^^^^^^
            This extra parameter is reserved for future expansion and will
            be used for more control over pointers in future versions.

05/27/2002: beazley
            Fix for C++ classes with private assignment operators.  It
            is now possible to safely return objects like this by value.
            Caveat:  the class must provide a copy constructor.
	    
05/26/2002: beazley
            -proxy option added to many language modules.  This is the
            same as -shadow.  We are merely changing terminology.
            
05/26/2002: beazley
            [perl] Fixed some inconsistencies in the -package option.
            -package merely sets the package name to be used on the
            wrappers.  It does not change the name of the shared library
            file or the name of the generated .pm file.  This was
            broken at some point, but works again now.

05/25/2002: beazley
            [perl] Fixed [ 475452 ] memory leak in return-by-value.
            Problem related to static member variables returning newly
            allocated objects. Reported by Roy Lecates.
 
05/25/2002: beazley
            [perl] Fixed [ 513134 ] %BLESSEDMEMBERS isn't always right.
            Reported by Fleur Diana Dragan.

05/25/2002: beazley
            Fixed [ 540735 ] -importall and the -I option.

05/25/2002: beazley
            [guile] Fixed [ 532723 ] Default arg for char* can SegV.  
            Error in guile module.  Reported by Brett Williams.

05/25/2002: beazley
            Subtle change to typemap application code.  The "freearg"
            typemap must exactly match up with the "in" or "ignore"
            typemap.  For example:

                 %typemap(in) (char *data, int len) { ... };
                 %typemap(freearg) char *data { ... }; 

                 void foo(char *data, int len);

             In this case, the "in" typemap is applied, but the
             freearg typemap is not.  This is because the freearg
             typemap doesn't match up with the input argument sequence.

05/25/2002: beazley
            Fixed [ 548272 ] Default argument code missing braces.
            Reported by Brett Williams.

05/25/2002: beazley
            Fixed [ 547730 ] SwigValueWrapper needed for constructors.
            Reported by William Fulton.

05/25/2002: beazley
            Undefined identifiers now evaluate to 0 when evaluating
            preprocessor expressions.  For example:

                  #if !FOO
                  ...
                  #endif
      
            where FOO is undefined or set to some non-numeric value.

            Fixes [ 540868 ] #if defined whatever - not parsed.
            Reported by Adam Hupp.

 
05/24/2002: beazley
            SWIG now ignores the C++ 'export' keyword.

05/23/2002: beazley
            Some refinement of type-name mangling to account for pointers, arrays,
            references, and other embedded type constructs.

05/23/2002: beazley
            Initial attempt at supporting template partial specialization.  At
            the very least, it is parsed and the classes are stored.  Matching
            of instantiations to specialized version is more limited and based on
            the SWIG default typemap rules:

                     SWIGTYPE *
                     SWIGTYPE []
                     SWIGTYPE &

            Now, why in the world would you want to use this feature?  Other
            than allowing for slightly modified class APIs, this capability is
            primarily used to provide advanced wrapping support for STL-like
            objects.  It can also be mixed with typemaps.  Here is an example:


                /* Generic version */
                template<class T> class vector {
                    %typemap(in) vector<T> * {
                        // A container of objects 
                    }
                };
                /* Partial specialization (pointers) */
                template<class T> class vector<T *> {
                    %typemap(in) vector<T> * {
                        // A container of pointers to objects.
                    }
                };
                /* Specialization (integers). */
                template<> class vector<int> {
                    %typemap(in) vector<int> * {
                        // A container of integers.
                    }
                };

             *** EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE ***
            
05/23/2002: beazley
            Enhancement to typemaps.   Normally, typemap variables are
            renamed to avoid conflicts.  For example:

               %typemap(in) int * (int temp) {
                    $1 = &temp;
               }

            This results in code that creates and uses variables "temp1","temp2", 
            "temp3" and so forth depending on how many times the typemap is used.
            Sometimes you want a single variable instead.  To do that, using
            the following naming scheme:

                %typemap(in) int *(int _global_temp) {
                }
 
            Is this case, a single variable _global_temp is emitted in the
            wrapper functions.  It is shared across all typemaps.  Repeated
            typemaps do not replicate the variable---they use the first one
            emitted.
            *** NEW FEATURE ***
           
05/23/2002: beazley
            Minor enhancement to typemaps.  If you have this code,

               %typemap(in) Foo (int somevar = 3) {
                     ...
               }

            the default value for somevar is now emitted into the wrapper code.

05/22/2002: beazley
            Fixed %extend to be better behaved in namespaces.  If you have code
            like this:

                namespace foo {
                     struct bar {
                        %extend {
                             void blah();
                        };
                     };
                }
  
            SWIG matches the blah() method to a C function named 
            void foo_bar_blah(foo::bar *self).

            This is consistent with the non-namespace version.
            Bug reported by Marcelo Matus.

05/22/2002: beazley
            New library files: cpointer.i, carrays.i, cmalloc.i.  These
            provide access to C pointers and memory allocation functions.
            See Doc/Manual/Library.html for details.

05/22/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] C type char no longer maps to Java type byte, but to Java type char.
            It is now treated as a character rather than a signed number. This fits in
            with the other language modules and is a more natural mapping as char* is 
            mapped as a string of characters. Note that the C signed char type is still
            mapped to a Java byte.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR JAVA MODULE ***

05/22/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Improved constants wrapping. Constants (#define and %constant) values 
            are now obtained through a JNI call. Previously the value was compiled as 
            Java code, but this didn't work for all cases, eg #define 123ULL.

05/22/2002: beazley
            Fixed bogus error message with %extend directive and C++
            access specifiers.  Reported by Marcelo Matus.

05/22/2002: beazley
            Namespaces and enums now work correctly.  For example:

                namespace Foo {
                    enum Bar { A, B };
                }

            Bug reported by Marcelo Matus.

05/21/2002: beazley
            The %types directive can now be used to specify inheritance relationships
            in the runtime type system.  For example,

                %types(Foo = Bar);

            specifies that Foo isa Bar.    Using this is potentially quite dangerous.
            However, this is useful in certain cases (and in the SWIG library).
            
05/20/2002: beazley
            %nodefault and %makedefault directives now require a trailing semicolon.
            For example:

                %nodefault;
                ...
                %makedefault;

            In addition both directives can take a class name.  For example:

                %nodefault Foo;

                class Foo {   /* No default constructor/destructor */
                };

                class Bar {  /* Default constructor/destructor generated */
                };

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
            If you don't use the trailing semicolon, things will mysteriously break.

05/20/2002: beazley
            More improvements to type system handling.  SWIG now correctly handles
            template names and parameters in a namespace. For example:

                namespace foo {
                    template<class T> class bar { };
                    typedef int Integer;

                    void blah(bar<Integer> *x);
                };

            In the generated code, all of the typenames are properly qualified.

05/17/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] deprecated broken -jnic and -jnicpp commandline options. The C or C++ 
            JNI calling convention is now determined from the -c++ commandline option.

05/16/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] The JCALL macros which exist so that the same typemaps can be used
            for generating both the C and C++ JNI calling conventions no longer appear
            in the generated code. This is because the output is now passed through the 
            SWIG preprocessor which does the macro expansion for either C or C++ (depending
            on whether -c++ is passed on the SWIG commandline).

            The generation of the functions used in the array typemaps have been adjusted 
            to take account of this. The side effect is that any typemaps which contained 
            JCALL macros within %{ %} brackets will have to be moved within {} brackets 
            so that the SWIG preprocessor can expand the macros.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR JAVA MODULE ***

05/13/2002: beazley
            Class templates may now be used as template parameters.  For example:

              template<class T, template<class> class C> class Foo {
                  ...
              };
              template<class T> class Bar {
                  ...
              };

              %template(Fooi) Foo<int, Bar>;
     
            SWIG doesn't really do anything special with this---it's just
            another way of specifying a template parameter.  
         
05/13/2002: beazley
            Minor refinement of template support.  Template parameter names are no longer
            required for types.  For example:

                template<bool> class Foo {
                };

            Obviously, names are required for template<class T>;

05/12/2002: beazley
            New macro expansion in typemaps.  The sequence:

                $descriptor(type)

            Will expand into the SWIG type descriptor structor for
            the given type.  Type may be any abstract datatype.
            For example:

                $descriptor(int *)
                $descriptor(int (*)(int,double))
                $descriptor(vector<int> *)

            Caveat: It is *NOT* currently legal to use other typemap
            substitution variables in the macro.  For example 
            $descriptor($1_type).

            The primary purpose of this modification is to better
            support typemaps for container objects or to allow typemaps
            that might be performing type conversions.
            *** NEW FEATURE ***

05/11/2002: beazley
            The wrapping of references to primitive types has been
            changed as follows:

            Arguments of type 'const primitive &' are now passed
            by value as opposed to pointers.  Return values of
            type 'const primitive &' are returned as values instead of
            pointers.

            'primitive' is any one of int, short, long, long long,
            char, float, double, bool (as well as unsigned variants).
            
            This change is being made to better support C++ wrapping--especially
            code that makes use of templates and the STL.

            The %template directive can now be used to access templates
            in a namespace.  For example:

                namespace std {
                    template<class T> class complex {
                       T re, im;
                    public:
                       complex(T _r = T(), T _i = T()) : re(_r), im(_i) { }
                       T real() { return re; }
                       T imag() { return im; }
                    };
                }

                %template(complex) std::complex<double>;

            Note: There are some very subtle namespace/symbol table 
            management issues involved in the implementation of this.
            It may not work in certain cases.

05/10/2002: beazley
            Member template constructor support added.  For example:

               template<typename _T1, typename _T2> 
               struct pair {
                 _T1 first;
                 _T2 second;
                 pair() : first(_T1()), second(_T2()) { }
                 template<class _U1, class _U2> pair(const pair<_U1,_U2> &x);
               };

            To instantiate the template, use %template and %extend.
            For example, this expands the constructor into a default
            copy constructor:

               %extend pair {
                  %template(pair) pair<_T1,_T2>;
               }
            
            Highly experimental.  Other uses may be broken.

05/10/2002: beazley
            The %extend (%addmethods) directive no longer works unless
            it appears in the public section of a class.   An error
            message is now generated (as opposed to a segmentation fault).

05/09/2002: beazley
            New %warnfilter() directive.  This directive attaches a warning
            filter to specific declarations and has the same semantics as
            %rename, %ignore, %feature, and so forth.  For example:

               %warnfilter(501) foo;   // Suppress overloaded warning
               int foo(int);
               int foo(double); 

            or

               %warnfilter(501) Object::foo(double);
               class Object {
               public:
                  int foo(int);
                  int foo(double);
               };

            This feature only suppresses warnings in later stages of code
            generation.  It does not suppress warnings related to preprocessing
            or parsing.
            *** NEW FEATURE ***

05/09/2002: beazley
            SWIG now supports C99 variadic preprocessor macros.  For example:

               #define debugf(fmt,...) fprintf(stderr,fmt,__VA_ARGS__)

            The argument "..." is used to indicate variable arguments which
            are all placed into the special argument name __VA_ARGS__ in
            the macro expansion.  

            SWIG also implements the GNU (##) extension for swallowing the
            preceding comma when __VA_ARGS__ is empty. For example:

               #define debugf(fmt,...) fprintf(stderr,fmt, ##__VA_ARGS__)

            Here is how this is expanded:

               debugf("%d", 3)  --> fprintf(stderr,"%d",3)
               debugf("Hello")  --> fprintf(stderr,"Hello" )

            (notice the deleted comma).

            [Ruby] A copy constructor is now turned into a "clone"
            instance method (see Dave's change for copy constructors

            to do for Ruby code.

            [Ruby] Fixed [ 553864 ] Inline destructor code not written.

05/08/2002: beazley
            %ignore behaves better with constructors, destructors, and the
            type system in general.   For constructors and destructors,
            %ignore now suppresses the creation of a default constructor
            or destructor.  For example:

                 %ignore ~Foo;
                 class Foo {
                 public:
                     Foo();
                    ~Foo();
                     ...
                 };

            In SWIG-1.3.11, ~Foo() simply "disappeared" and the code generator
            created a wrapper for a default destructor (as if it was never
            declared in the interface).  In SWIG-1.3.12, %ignore suppresses
            the creation of a destructor if one is actually defined. 

            Similarly, even though a declaration is ignored, information
            may still be needed to properly handle types. For example, here
            is a very subtle error that is fixed by this change:

                %ignore std::string;         // Prevent class wrapping
                namespace std {
                   class string {
                        ...
                   };
                   %typemap(in) string * {
                        ...
                   }
                }
                
                void foo(std::string *s);   // Broken.

            Before this fix, %ignore would cause the class definition to disappear.
            This, in turn, would cause the typemap to be misapplied. 
 
05/08/2002: beazley
            Minor changes to %rename, %ignore, %feature, and related directives
            for better support of destructors.  Destructors can now be precisely
            tagged.  For example:

                  %ignore Foo::~Foo;
                  %feature("action") ~Bar {
                      ...
                  }
             
            *Developer warning* 
            Operations such as renaming and feature attachment for classes used to
            be applied to destructors as well.  For instance, if you did this:
 
                 %rename(Bar) Foo;

            The operation applied to the class itself, the constructor, and
            the destructor.   This is no longer the case.  Now such operations
            will only apply to the class and the constructor.  Note: if you
            were relying on this for class renaming, be aware that renamed
            classes should really only be handled at the level of the class itself
            and not the level of individual declarations in the class (although
            they can be renamed individually if needed).  As far as I know,
            the Language class is already taking care of this case correctly.

05/07/2002: beazley
            New set of tests.  The Examples/test-suite/errors directory contains
            tests that try to exercise all of SWIG's error and warning messages.

05/07/2002: beazley
            Start of a warning framework.  Warning messages are now assigned numeric values
            that are shown in warning messages.   These can be suppressed using the
            -w option.  For example:

                 swig -w302 example.i
                 swig -w302,305 example.i

            Alternatively, the #pragma preprocessor directive can be used to disable this:

                 #pragma SWIG nowarn=302
                 #pragma SWIG nowarn=302,305

            Note: Since SWIG is a multi-pass compiler, this pragma should
            only be used to change global settings of the warning filter.  It should
            not be used to selectively enable/disable warnings in an interface file.
            The handling of #pragma occurs in the C++ preprocoessor and affects all 
            subsequent stages of compilation.

            The -Wall option turns on all warnings and overrides any filters that
            might have been set.

            Warnings can be issued from an interface using %warn.  For example:

                 %warn "110:%section is deprecated"

            The first part of a warning message is an optional warning number.
            A complete set of warning numbers is found in Source/Include/swigwarn.h.

05/07/2002: beazley
            Internal parsing change.   Directives to include files now use brackets [ ... ]

                  %includefile "foo.i" [
                     ...
                  ]

            The use of { ... } was a bad choice because they were included implicitly by
            the preprocessor and made it impossible to properly detect legitimate missing '}' 
            errors.

            SWIG European Tour: Paris-Amsterdam-Bath.

04/23/2002: beazley
            The %addmethods directive has been renamed to %extend.
            For example:

                class Foo {
                ...
                };

                %extend Foo {
                   int blah() { ... };
                   int bar() { ... };
                   ...
                };

            Motivation: the %addmethods directive can be used for many
            other tasks including adding synthesized attributes, constructors,
            and typemaps. Because of this, "addmethods" is somewhat misleading.
            %extend more precisely describes this operation---extension of a
            class or structure.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
            %addmethods still works via a macro definition.   However,
            a warning message may be generated.   Errors involving %addmethods
            will actually refer to the %extend directive.  
            
04/23/2002: beazley
            Further refinement of the type system.  Typedef now
            propagates through functions, pointers to functions,
            and pointers to member functions.
            For example:

               typedef int Integer;
               void foo(int (*x)(int), Integer (*y)(Integer));

            In this case, arguments 'x' and 'y' have exactly
            the same type (and would obviously accept objects
            of either type).

            Similarly, consider this:

               class Foo {
               };

               typedef Foo Bar;
               void bar(int (Foo::*x)(int), int (Bar::*y)(int));

            In this case, arguments x and y are the same 
            type (via typedef).
            
04/22/2002: beazley
            SWIG now generates a warning message if any part of
            an expression involves values from a private part of a class.
            For example:

                class Foo {
                private:
                    static int X;
                public:
                     void blah(int a, int b = X);   // Warning
                };

            In this case, the default argument is ignored.  There
            are workarounds, but they are rather clumsy.  For instance,
            you might do this:

                    %feature("action") blah(int,int) {
                       if ($nargs == 1) {
                          result = blah(arg1);
                       } else {
                          result = blah(arg1,arg2);
                       }
                    }
                    void blah(int a, int b = 0);


04/21/2002: beazley
            Use of the %inline directive inside a namespace is
            forbidden and now generates an error message.   This is
            not allowed since the inlined code that is emitted is
            not placed inside a namespace.  This confuses other
            stages of parsing.
                    
04/21/2002: beazley
            Some bug fixes to casting operations and expression
            parsing.   Due to some parsing issues, it is not 
            currently possible to use casts for all possible
            datatypes.   However, the common cases work.

04/20/2002: beazley (Amsterdam)
            Member templates now work.  Simply use the %template
            directive inside a class or %addmethods to create
            instantiations (see Doc/Manual/SWIGPlus.html).  Supporting
            this was easy---earlier changes to templates made it
            possible using only a two-line modification to the parser
            and a few minor modifications elsewhere.  Hmmm, come to 
            think of it, the smoke was rather thick in that Internet "cafe".

            Simple numbers and strings can be used with the %template
            directive as well.  For example:

                 %template(vecint100) vector<int,100>;

            Note: Arithmetic expressions are not currently allowed.
            
            Default template arguments now work and do not have to
            be given to %template.
                        
04/18/2002: beazley (Paris)
            Change in internal template handling.  Template
            parameters are now fully integrated into the type
            system and are aware of typedefs, etc.  This builds
            upon the change below.   

            *** DEVELOPER WARNING ***
            Word of caution to language module writers.  The "name"
            parameter of certain parse tree nodes (classes, functions, etc.)
            may be parameterized with types.   This parameterization is
            done using SWIG type-strings and not the underlying C version.
            For example,

               int max<int *>(int *,int *)  

            has a name of "max<(p.int)>".  If you use the name directly,
            you may get syntax errors in the generated code.  To fix this,
            use SwigType_namestr(name) to convert a parameterized name 
            to a C name with valid syntax.  The internal version is
            used to reduce template types to a common representation 
            and to handle issues of typedef.
            
04/16/2002: beazley (somewhere over the Atlantic)
            Enhancement of typedef resolution.  The type system is now
            aware of template arguments and typedef.  For example:

                  typedef int Integer;
                 
                  foo(vector<int> *x, vector<Integer> *y);

            In this case, vector<int> and vector<Integer> are
            the same type.   There is some interaction between this
            mechanism and the implementation of typemaps.  For example,
            a typemap defined for vector<int> * would apply to either type.
            However, a typemap for vector<Integer> * would only apply to
            that type.

            Typedefs and typemaps and matched by left-most expansion.
            For example:

              vector<Integer,Integer> --> 
              vector<int, Integer> -->
              vector<int, int>

            [Java] Changes to Java shadow classes.
            Overcomes a bug where the module assumed that a pointer to a derived
            class could be used in place of a pointer to a base class. Thanks 
            to Stephen McCaul for analysing the bug and submitting patches.

            A consequence is that the getCPtr() method in each shadow class has
            disappeared and has been replaced with a getCPtrXXX(), where XXX is the 
            shadow class name. If you have code that previously used getCPtr(), 
            and the associated class is wrapping a C struct or a C++ class that
            is not involved in an inheritance chain, just use the new method. If
            however, the class is involved in an inheritance chain, you'll have
            to choose which pointer you really want. Backwards compatibility 
            has been broken as not using the correct pointer can lead to weird bugs
            through ill-defined behaviour. If you are sure you want the old methods, 
            you could add them back into all shadow classes by adding this at the 
            beginning of your interface file:

            %pragma(java) allshadowcode=%{
              public long getCPtr(){
                return swigCPtr;
              }
            %}

            Please see entry dated 07/23/2002 to see how to do this after the deprecation
            of the allshadowcode pragma.

               ...
               };

            When the %template directive is used, it will use a specialization
            if one is defined.   There are still some limitations. Partial
            specialization is not supported.  A template of type <void *> does
            not match all pointers.

            Major change to template wrapping internals. Template declarations are
            no longer processed as macros but now result in real parse-tree
            nodes.  The %template directive expands these nodes into a
            specific instantiation.   This change enables a number of
            new and interesting capabilities:

            Directives such as %rename, %feature, and %addmethods can
            now be applied to uninstantiated templates.  For example:

              %rename(barsize) vector::bar(char *buf, int len);
              ...
              template<typename T> class vector {
              public:
                 ...
                 void bar(char *buf);
                 void bar(char *buf, int len);   // Renamed
                 ...
              };

              %template(intvector) vector<int>;   // Renaming carries through

            
            By parsing templates into an internal data structure, it will
            be possible to support specialization (and maybe partial
            specialization).
            
            This is highly experimental and a work in progress.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
            In SWIG-1.3.11, template declarations were simply processed
            as weird macros.  No other information was retained.   This 
            made it impossible to support more advanced features and 
            complicated many other parts of the implementation.

04/09/2002: beazley
            Change to template class wrapping.   There were a variety of
            "issues" with the old approach related to parsing, the type
            system, and namespaces.   These changes are meant to rectify
            some of these problems:

            A specific instantiation of a template can now be specified
            by including the class inline like this:
 
                  class vector<int> {
                  public:
                       vector();
                      ~vector();
                       ... whatever ...
	                  };

            This is template specialization, but partial specialization is
            not yet implemented.
            
            The %template directive has been modified to expand roughly as
            follows:

                 %template(vecint) vector<int>;

            becomes

                 %rename(vecint> vector<int>;
                 class vector<int> {
                 public:
                     vector();
                     ...
                 };

            Note that this simply builds upon the code above (templates
            included inline).

            This modified approach to wrapping fixes some subtle type
            issues.  For instance, you can now define typemaps and typedefs
            like this:

                 %typemap(in) vector<int> * {
                 ...
                 }
                 typedef vector<int> intvector;
                 ...
                 void blah(intvector *v);   // Gets the above typemap

            This did not work in SWIG-1.3.11 due to a peculiarity of
            the template implementation.

            %template(name) no longer installs the template as a class
            with name "name".   This might break %addmethods as described
            in the manual.  For example:

                 %template(vecint) vector<int>;
                 %addmethods vecint {    // Fails. vecint not a class
                   ...
                 };
           
            To fix this, just use the template name instead:

                 %addmethods vector<int> {
                     ...
                 }

            Note: This technique might be a way to implement some bizarre
            template specialization techniques.   For example:

                 %addmethods vector<int> {
                     // Only applied if vector<int> instantiated later
                     %typemap(in) vector<int> * {
                        ...
                     }
                     ...
                 };

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
             
04/08/2002: beazley
            Fixed [ 540868 ] #if defined whatever - not parsed.  SWIG should
            now correctly handle preprocessor directives like this:

                #if defined __cplusplus
                ...
                #endif
             
            Note: was implemented previously, but there was a minor bug.
            Reported by Adam Hupp.
                   
04/07/2002: beazley
            %readonly and %readwrite are deprecated due to a change in the 
            implementation.  Instead of being pragmas, mutability is now
            controlled as a "feature" using the following two directives:

                 %immutable;
                 int x;           // read-only variable
                 int y;           // read-only variable
                 %mutable;
                 int z;           // Modifiable

            %immutable and %mutable are much more powerful than their older
            counterparts.  They can now pinpoint a specific declaration like
            this:

               %immutable  x;         /* Any x */
               %immutable  Foo::x;    /* x in class Foo */

            In fact, the matching algorithm is the same as for %rename, 
            %ignore, and other directives.   This means that the declaration
      
               %immutable  Foo::x;

            would not only apply to class Foo but to all derived classes
            as well.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
            %immutable and %mutable must be terminated by a semi-colon.  This
            differs slightly from the older %readonly and %readwrite directives.
            Since %immutable and %mutable can be applied to declarations the
            semicolon is needed to distinguish between a global feature and 
            one targeted to a single declaration.  Note: this incompatibility is the
            primary reason for changing the name of the directive.

04/07/2002: beazley
            New handling of copy constructors.  If a class defines 
            constructors like this:

                class Foo {
                public:
                      Foo();
                      Foo(const Foo &);       // Copy constructor
                      ...
                };

            SWIG now generates a function copy_Foo() for the copy
            constructor.

            In previous verions, this generated a name-clash and an
            error message.   To preserve backwards compatibility, SWIG
            does not change the behavior if %rename is used to resolve
            the name conflict.   However, if no name resolution is made,
            this new approach is used.

            Copy constructors may be handled as a special case in the
            target language.  However, this is up to the language module
            itself.
                  
04/07/2002: beazley
            The %template directive is now namespace aware.   This allows
            code like this:

                namespace foo {
                    template<typename T> max(T a, T b) { return a > b ? a : b; }
                }

                using namespace foo;
                %template(maxint) max<int>;            // Ok

                namespace bar {
                   using foo::max;
                   %template(maxdouble) max<double>;   // Ok
                }

            Caveat: the template name supplied to %template must be defined in the
            same scope in which the %template directive appears.   This code is
            illegal:

                %template(maxint) foo::max<int>;

04/07/2002: beazley
            Minor enhancement to preprocessor.   The preprocessor can now perform
            string comparison.   For example:

               #define A "hello"
               ...
               #if A == "hello"
               ...
               #endif

            The primary use of this is in SWIG macros.  For example:

              %define FOO(x) 
              #if #x == "int"
              /* Special handling for int */
              ...
              #endif
              %enddef

            Normal users can probably safely ignore this feature.  However, it may
            be used in parts of the SWIG library.

04/07/2002: beazley
            Further refinement of default constructor/destructor wrapper generation.
            SWIG is now much more aware of pure virtual methods. For instance:

              class A {             /* Abstract */
              public:
                 virtual void method1() = 0;
                 virtual void method2() = 0;
              };
              class B : public A {  /* Abstract */
              public:
                 virtual void method1() { };
              };

              class C : public B {  /* Ok */
              public:
                 virtual void method2() { };
              };

            In this case, SWIG will only generate default constructors for C.
            Even though B looks fine, it's missing a required method and is abstract.

04/04/2002: beazley
            Subtle change to structure data member access.  If you
            have a structure like this:

                struct Foo {
                    Bar   b;
                };

            The accessor functions for b are generated as follows:

            (1) If b is *not* defined as a structure or class:

                Bar Foo_b_get(Foo *self) {
                    return self->b;
                }
                void Foo_b_set(Foo *self, Bar value) {
                    self->b = value;
                }

            (2) If b *is* defined as a structure or class:

                Bar *Foo_b_get(Foo *self) {
                    return &self->b;
                }
                void Foo_b_set(Foo *self, Bar *value) {
                    self->b = *value;
                }
            See the "Structure data members" section of Doc/Manual/SWIG.html
            for further details.

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
            This may break interfaces that relied on a lot of a undeclared
            structure and class names.    To get the old behavior, simply
            use a forward declaration such as "struct Bar;"
            
04/04/2002: beazley
            C++ namespace support added.  SWIG supports all aspects of
            namespaces including namespace, using, and namespace alias
            declarations.    The default behavior of SWIG is to flatten
            namespaces in the target language.  However, namespaces are
            fully supported at the C++ level and in the type system.
            See Doc/Manual/SWIGPlus.html for details on the implementation.

            C++-namespace support in SWIG directives.

            %addmethods: 

            The %addmethods directive now accepts a fully qualified classname
            and can be used inside C++ namespace declarations.  For example:

                 // Attaches to the class Foo::Bar below
                 %addmethods Foo::Bar {
                     int somemethod() { ... }
                 };

                 namespace Foo {
                    class Bar {
                    public:
                        ...
                    };
                 
                    // Attaches to the class Bar above
                    %addmethods Bar {
                      int othermethod() { ... };
                    }
                 }

            %feature, %rename, %ignore, %exception, and related directives:

            Namespaces are fully integrated into the renaming and declaration
            matcher.  For example:

                 %rename(display) Foo::print;          // Rename in namespace Foo
                 %ignore Foo::Bar::blah;               // Ignore a declaration

            %rename directives can be placed inside namespace blocks as well. For
            example:

                namespace Foo {
                   %rename(display) print;         // Applies to print below

                   void print();
                };

            Most other SWIG directives should work properly inside namespaces.
            No other changes are needed.
      
03/22/2002: beazley
            Some changes to internal symbol table handling.   SWIG no longer
            manages structures and unions in a separate namespace than normal
            declarations like ANSI C.  This means you can't have a structure
            with the same name as a function.  For example:

                 struct Foo {
                 ...
                 }
 
                 int Foo() { ... }

            This approach is more like C++.   It's not clear that SWIG ever
            really supported the ANSI C anyways---using the same name would
            almost certainly generate a name-clash in the target language.

03/22/2002: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] Fixed [ 517302 ] for handling of renamed overloaded
            constructors. Now, renamed overloaded constructors are converted
            into class singleton methods (basically acting as "factory"
            methods).

03/21/2002: beazley
            Fixed [ 532957 ] %ignore parse error and casting operator.
            Reported by William Fulton.

03/18/2002: beazley (** ADVANCED USERS ONLY **)
            Added support for dynamic casting in return values.  A somewhat
            common problem in certain C++ programs is functions that hide
            the identity of underlying objects when they are returned 
            from methods and functions.  For example, a program might include
            some generic method like this:

                      Node *getNode();

            However, Node * may just be base class to a whole hierarchy
            of different objects.   Instead of returning this generic Node *,
            it might be nice to automatically downcast the object into the
            appropriate type using some kind dynamic cast.

            Assuming you understand the peril involved, a downcast can now
            be performed using the following function in the run-time type
            checker:

              swig_type_info *SWIG_TypeDynamicCast(swig_type_info *, void **ptr);

            This function checks to see if the type can be converted to another
            type.  If so, a different type descriptor (for the converted type)
            is returned.   This type descriptor would then be used to create
            a pointer in the target language.

            To use this, you would write a typemap similar to this:

              %typemap(out) Node * {
                swig_type_info *ty = SWIG_TypeDynamicCast($1_descriptor, (void **) &$1);
                $result = SWIG_NewPointerObj($1, ty);
              }

            Alternatively,

              %typemap(out) Node * = SWIGTYPE *DYNAMIC;

            To make the typemap have any effect, you have to write a supporting 
            function that knows how to perform downcasting. For example:

              %{
              static swig_type_info *
              Node_dynamic_cast(void **ptr) {
                 Node **nptr = (Node **) ptr;
                 Element *e = dynamic_cast<Element *>(*nptr);
                 if (e) {
                    *ptr = (void *) e;
                    return SWIGTYPE_p_Element;
                 }
                 Data *d = dynamic_cast<Data *>(*nptr);
                 if (d) {
                    *ptr = (void *) d;
                    return SWIGTYPE_p_Data;
                 }
                 return 0;
              }
              %}

            There is no restriction on how types are determined. dynamic_cast<>
            uses C++ RTTI.  However, if you had some other mechanism for determining
            the type, you could use that here.  Note: it is important to save
            the new pointer value back into the argument as shown.  When downcasting,
            the value of the pointer could change. 

            Finally, to make the casting function available, you have to register
            it with the run-time type checker. Put this macro in your interface file.

               DYNAMIC_CAST(SWIGTYPE_p_Node, Node_dynamic_cast);

            Note: this feature does not introduce a performance penalty on 
            normal SWIG operation.  The feature is only enabled by writing
            a new typemap that explicitly calls SWIG_TypeDynamicCast() to
            make a conversion. 
  
            Examples/test-suite/dynamic_cast.i contains a simple example.
            This feature is not supported in the Java module due to differences
            in the type-checking implementation.

            *** EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE ***

03/17/2002: beazley
            Small change to type-name handling of unnamed structures and
            typedef.  If a structure of this form appears:

                   typedef struct {
                        ...
                   } Foo;

            Then 'Foo' is used as the proper typename for the structure.
            Furthermore, Foo can now be used as a name in C++ inheritance.
            SWIG was already kind of doing this, but this modification refines
            the implementation to more closely follow the C++ ARM, section
            7.1.3, p. 106.  This fixes a couple of obscure corner cases.

03/16/2002: beazley
            Modified C++ inheritance with a few enhancements.  First, type information
            needed for casting and type-equivalence is generated even when base-classes
            aren't defined in the interface.  For example:

                class Foo : public Bar  {    /* Bar unspecified */
                public:
                  ...
                };

               void blah(Bar *b);

            In this case, the blah() function still accepts Foo * even though nothing
            is really known about Bar.   Previous SWIG versions would just generate
            a type error.

            Inheritance has also been modified to work through typedef.  For example:

               class Bar {
               };

               typedef Bar OtherBar;
               class Foo: public OtherBar {
               }

            In this case, the base class of OtherBar is correctly resolved back to
            Bar.   The use of the name OtherBar is lost in this resolution (the wrappers
            will simply use Bar instead of the typedef name OtherBar).
           
03/13/2002: beazley
            %typemap, %apply, and related directives can now appear inside
            class definitions.   

03/13/2002: beazley
            Fixed a variety of problems related to compiling SWIG on 64-bit
            platforms.

03/12/2002: beazley
            Fixed problem with "ignore" and "in" typemaps.  Local variables
            associated with "in" were being added to the wrapper function even
            though they were never used.   Mostly harmless, but it would lead
            to a variety of compilation warnings.
  
03/12/2002: beazley
            Some changes to the internal type system and handling of nested C++
            types.   In previous versions of SWIG, if you had the following:

                 class Foo {
                 public:
                      typedef int Blah;
                 };
                 class Bar : public Foo {
                 public:
                       void somemethod(Blah x);
                 };

            The argument type in somemethod() would implicitly be set to Bar::Blah.
            Although this is technically allowed, it breaks typemaps.  For example:

                 %typemap(in) Foo::Blah { ... }

            doesn't match like you expect.   This has been changed in SWIG-1.3.12.
            Now, types are expanded using the class in which they were defined.
            So, the argument type in somemethod() will be Foo::Blah---since the
            type Blah was defined in Foo.
 
03/10/2002: beazley
            Fixed some subtle type scoping problems with typedef and C++ classes.
            For example:
 
                typedef int Blah;
                class Bar {
                public:
                    typedef double Blah;
                    void foo(Blah x, ::Blah y);
                ...
                }

03/10/2002: beazley
            Highly experimental change to handle variable length arguments.
            First, there is no portable or reliable way to wrap
            a varargs function in full generality.  However, you *can* change
            the function signature using %varargs.

               %varargs(char *) fprintf;
               ...
               void fprintf(FILE *f, char *fmt, ...);

            In this case, the variable length parameter "..." is
            simply replaced by the parameters given in %varargs. This
            results in a function like this:

               void fprintf(FILE *f, char *fmt, char *s);

            More than one argument can be used and default values
            can be defined.  For example, this code specifies a
            maximum of four arguments.

               %varargs(char *x1 = 0, char *x2 = 0, char *x3 = 0, char *x4 = 0) fprintf;
 
            *** EXPERIMENTAL NEW FEATURE ***
 
03/10/2002: beazley
            Change to handling of variable length arguments.  varargs
            is now handled as a proper parameter and is passed to the
            code generator.  However, it still can't be handled correctly
            (and will generate a typemap warning).   This change has been
            made to better incorporate variable length arguments with other
            directives such as %ignore, %rename, %feature, and so forth.

03/10/2002: beazley
            Fixed [ 522555 ] Syntax error parsing "define" construct. SWIG
            is a little more restrictive in determining #define statements
            that will be wrapped as constants.  Also added a better parser
            error rule for handling bad constants.

03/08/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Bug fix: Classes renamed with %rename that are derived from 
            another class generate more appropriate shadow class code.

03/08/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Fixed SF [ #523632 ] and [ #513335 ] both reported by Israel 
            Tanner. Support for types that are used which are in a typedef. The
            appropriate shadow class name is generated. Also generated correct
            shadow classname when a templated class is used within another 
            templated class. See the cpp_typedef.i testcase.

03/08/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            [Java] Bug fix: No type was generated in shadow classes for types 
            that weren't wrapped by SWIG.  The type is treated as a raw 
            pointer, ie no shadow class.

02/22/2002: beazley
            Refined the matching algorithm used by %rename, %ignore, and
            %feature.   If a type signature is supplied, it must exactly
            match that used in the declaration---including any use of
            const.  For example:

                %rename(foo1)   foo(int);
                %rename(bar1)   bar(int) const;

                class Blah {
                   public:
                      void foo(int);       // Matched --> foo1
                      void foo(int) const; // Not matched 
                      void bar(int);       // Not matched
                      void bar(int) const; // Matched --> bar1
                }

            In previous versions, a non-const specification would match
            both the non-const and const declarations.  However, the whole
            point of %rename and related directives is that they be able
            to precisely pinpoint exact declarations in an interface.  This
            fixes the problem.

02/21/2002: beazley
            Reworked the handling of default constructor and destructors.
            SWIG now makes a preliminary pass over the parse tree to discover
            which classes support default allocation.   This fixes a number
            of very subtle issues in code generation and call/return by value.

02/18/2002: cheetah (William Fulton)
            Improved support on Cygwin: Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby and Java should
            work out of the box, barring the runtime library. Removed dllwrap 
            and replaced with newly working gcc -shared instead for Cygwin. 
            All this will require the new improved binutils 20010802 and later,
            but the latest Cygwin is usually the best recommendation.

02/15/2002: beazley

            [Ruby] Made a fix to the code generation for C++ class
            constructors so that we get both a "new" singleton method
            and an "initialize" instance method for each class. This
            change enables developers to derive new Ruby classes from
            SWIG-wrapped C++ classes and then override their initialize
            methods to provide subclass-specific instance initialization.

02/14/2002: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] Bug fix: Enumerations defined within a class (such
            as those seen in the Examples/ruby/enum example) were not
            being exported with the correct names. Reported by William
            Fulton.

02/13/2002: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] Added a warning message when we run across overloaded
            class constructors for C++ code, that this is currently not
            supported (even if the overloads have been %renamed). For an
            example of where this doesn't work, see Examples/ruby/operator.

02/13/2002: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] Added an "ignored" warning message when the parser runs
            across an operator!=() declaration for C++ code.

02/11/2002: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] Added the "import", "import_template", "operator" and
            "template" examples.

            [Ruby] Added multi-module support.

02/09/2002: ljohnson (Lyle Johnson)
            [Ruby] Added the missing "#define SWIG_NOINCLUDE" at the top of

Version 1.3.11 (January 31, 2002)
=================================

01/30/2002: beazley
            Fix to pass/return by value for C++ objects that define
            no default constructor.  Changes to the typemap system
            made it impossible to wrap C++ objects with no default
            constructor.   This has been fixed, but the solution 
            involves some clever template magic contributed by 
            William Fulton.  Please see the comments in the file
            Lib/swig.swg for further details.  This solution is
            experimental and may be refined in a future release.

01/30/2002: beazley
            Global variables and member data of type "const char *"
            can be set, but the old value is silently discarded without
            any garbage collection.   This may generate a memory leak.
            This change is needed to more safely handle variables
            like this:

                   const char *foo = "Hello World\n";

            In this case, it's not safe to free the old value.  However,
            SWIG can dynamically allocate a new value and make foo point
            to it.   To fix this memory leak, you can probably do this:

               %clear const char *foo;
               %apply char * {const char *foo};

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
            
01/30/2002: beazley
            Two minor typemap enhancements have been added.  First,
            typemaps can issue a warning message by including a special
            warning attribute. For example:

             %typemap(in,warning="I'm going to do something dangerous") ...

            The warning message will show up whenever the typemap is
            applied.

            Second, a typemap can force a no-match by defining

             %typemap(in) sometype "pass";

            If this is used, the typemap system will *not* record a
            typemap match for "sometype".   This can be used to block
            selected typemaps.  For example, if you wanted to disable
            a typemap feature for some type, you could do this.

               // Do not allow global variables of type 'const char *' to be set.
               %typemap(varin) const char * "pass";

            It might also be possible to use this to do subtle and
            strange things with typemaps.  For example, if you wanted to
            make 'blah *' an output value and 'const blah *' an input
            parameter, you might do this:

                %typemap(ignore) blah *(blah temp) {
                    $1 = &temp;
                }
                %typemap(argout) blah * {
                    ... return a value ...
                }
                /* Block unqualified typemaps defined above */
                %typemap(ignore) const blah * "pass";
                %typemap(argout) const blah * "pass";
                %typemap(in)     const blah * {
                    ... get input value ...
                }

             (This potential applications of typemaps suggested by Greg Stein).

01/27/2002:beazley
           The ANSI C size_t type is now recognized as an integer by default.

01/26/2002:beazley
           long long and unsigned long long support added to many language modules.
           This is not a portable feature and will require compiler support
           for the long long type.  In target languages that do not support
           long long (e.g., Tcl and Perl), numbers are converted to a string
           of digits.  This prevents their use in arithmetic calculations, but
           still allows values to be set from a string.  

           long long support requires the use of the strtoll() and strtoull()
           functions as well as the 'lld' and 'llu' format specifiers
           of sprintf().

01/26/2002:beazley
           Fixed [ #501827 ] Delete method is not called.   The Tcl

           Reported by Reinhard Fobbe.

01/26/2002: beazley
           Better support for long long and unsigned long long.  Typemaps
           have been included in a number of modules for handling these types.
           In addition, the parser has been modified to accept long long
           literals such as 1234LL and 1234ULL.

01/18/2002: cheetah (william fulton)
           [Java] Corrected behaviour for functions that take arrays. For 
           example, when this c function: 

           void arrayfn(int array[]);
           
           is wrapped the corresponding native function

           public final static native void arrayfn(int[] array);

           is produced. Previously if the C function made any changes to the 
           array elements, these were not reflected back into the Java array. 
           This has now been corrected so that the changes are propogated back
           to Java and the calling function will see these changes. This is 
           how pure Java functions work, ie arrays are passed by reference.

           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

           This new mapping is more appropriate when interfacing to 32 bit 
           applications which are used in the current 32-bit JVMs. For future 
           64-bit JVMs you may have to change these mappings - eg on Unix LP64 
           systems, but not on Microsoft 64bit Windows which will be using a 
           P64 IL32 model. This may be automated in a future version of SWIG.

           Experimental change to parser to better support mixing of
           int, long, short, unsigned, float, and double.   The parser
           should now support types like this:
    
                short unsigned int
                int   unsigned short
                unsigned short int
                unsigned int short

            This change also enables a type of 'long double' (previously
            unsupported) to be used.
            *** NEW FEATURE ***

01/05/2002: cheetah (william fulton)
           [Java] Casting fix for when function return type is a pointer as 
           reported by Gary Pennington 2002-01-05. The upper 32bits of the 
           64 bit jlong will have contained junk for 32bit pointers.

01/05/2002: cheetah (william fulton)
           [Java] Better pointer handling in Java is possible as the 
           INPUT, OUTPUT and INOUT typemaps have been added into typemaps.i.

01/05/2002: cheetah (william fulton)
           [Java] $null can be used in input typemaps to return early from JNI 
           functions that have either void or a non-void return type. Example:

             %typemap(check) int * %{ 
               if (error) {
                 SWIG_exception(SWIG_IndexError, "Array element error");
                 return $null;
               }
             %}

           If the typemap gets put into a function with void as return, $null 
           will expand to nothing:

             void jni_fn(...) {
                 if (error) {
                   SWIG_exception(SWIG_IndexError, "Array element error");
                   return ;
                 }
               ...
             }

           otherwise $null expands to zero, where javareturntype is either a 
           pointer or a primitive type:

             javareturntype jni_fn(...) {
                 if (error) {
                   SWIG_exception(SWIG_IndexError, "Array element error");
                   return 0;

           [Java] The Java module incorrectly used argout typemaps for

           argout and freearg typemaps. This correction may require some user

           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

12/22/2001:beazley
           Resolved some inconsistent behavior with %rename and class renaming.
           If you specify the following:
 
               %rename(Foo)  Bar;

               class Bar {
               public:
                    Bar();
                    ~Bar();
               }

           Then the %rename directive applies to the class itself, the constructor,
           and the destructor (all will be renamed to Foo).

           If a class defines more than one constructor, the overloaded variants
           can still be renamed by specifying parameters to %rename.  For example:

               %rename(Bar_copy) Bar(Bar &);
               class Bar {
               public:
                     Bar();
                     Bar(Bar &);
                    ~Bar();
               };

           There are still some odd corner cases.  If you specify

               %rename(Foo) ::Bar;

           then only the name of the class is changed and the constructor/destructor
           names are left unmodified.  If you specify 

               %rename(Foo) *::Bar;

           then the names of the constructor/destructor functions are modified but
           the name of the class is not.

               #endif

Version 1.3.10 (December 10, 2001)
==================================

12/08/2001:beazley
           Modified %typemap so that %{ ... %} can also be used as a
           code block (mostly for completeness).  For example:
 
              %typemap(in) blah %{
                 ...
              %}

           This form does not introduce a new block scope.  Also, the
           code enclosed in %{ ... %} is not processed by the preprocessor.

           Patch submitted by Rich Wales.

12/03/2001:beazley
           New %exception directive.   This is intended to replace %except.
           It works in exactly the same manner except it does not accept a 
           language specifier. For example:

               %exception {
                   try {
                      $action
                   } 
                   catch(SomeError) {
                       error
                   }
               }

           %exception is also name aware---allowing it to be applied to
           specific declarations in an interface.  For example:

              %exception foo {
                  ...
                  exception for any function/method foo
                  ...
              }

              %exception Foo::bar {
                  ...
                  exception for method bar in class Foo
                  ...
              }
 
              %exception Foo::bar(double) {
                  ...
                  exception for method bar(double) in class Foo
                  ...
              }

           The semantics of this name matching is exactly the same as for %rename.
           *** NEW FEATURE ***
           
12/03/2001:beazley
           Substantial cleanup of the Python shadow class code.  Shadow classes
           used to be created in this rather complicated manner involving about
           a half-dozen strings created in bits and pieces.   Shadow classes
           are now generated in a more straightforward manner--in the same
           order that appears in the interface file.

           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
           The order in which declarations appear in the shadow file may differ.
           
12/03/2001:beazley
           The %insert directive (%{ ... %}, %runtime, %header, %wrapper, etc.)
           can now be used inside of a class definition.   This has potential
           uses when generating shadow class code.  For example:

                 class Foo {
                     ...
                 %insert("shadow") %{
                 # Some python code
                 def blah(self):
                      print "I'm blah!"
                 %}
                     ...
                 };

           The support for class code insertion depends on the language module.
           However, the intent of this feature is to simplify the task of extending
           shadow class code.   In the Python module, this inserts code with the
           proper level of indendation (regardless of what was used in the SWIG
           interface).
           *** NEW FEATURE ***

11/29/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
           Modifications for Java and Python modules to work on cygwin.
           Unfortunately a lot of the python module has started to produces code 
           which cannot be auto-imported using cygwin libtools so most of it is 
           still broken.

11/28/2001:beazley
           The %rename and %feature directive can now be used inside
           of a class definition. For example:

             class Foo {
                 %rename(foo_i) foo(int);
                 %rename(foo_d) foo(double);
             public:
                 ...
                 void foo(int);
                 void foo(double);
                 ...
             };

           When used in this manner, the %rename directive only applies
           to members of the class in which it appears as well as all
           derived classes.  In fact, this is really just the same
           as saying:

             %rename(foo_i) Foo::foo(int);
             %rename(foo_d) Foo::foo(double);
             class Foo {
                ...
             };

           *** NEW FEATURE ***

11/26/2001:beazley
           Added the experimental %feature directive.  %feature can be
           used to attach arbitrary string attributes to parse tree nodes.
           For example:

               %feature("except") blah {
                   try {
                      $function
                   } catch (Error) {
                       whatever;      
                   }
               }

           or

              %feature("set") *::x_set "x";

           or

              %feature("blah") Foo::bar(int,double) const "spam";

           The syntax is borrowed from the %rename directive.  In fact, the
           exact same semantics apply (inheritance, matching, etc.).

           %feature is a very powerful low-level primitive that can be used to
           customize individual language modules and to provide hints to 
           any stage of code generation.   Features are attached to
           parse tree nodes as attributes with names like "feature:*" where * 
           is replaced by the feature name (e.g., "feature:except", "feature:set", 
           etc.).   Language modules can then look for the features using 
           a simple attribute lookup.

           %feature is intended to be a replacement for a number of
           older SWIG directives including %except and specialized
           pragmas. It is more powerful (due to its parameterized
           name matching) and it provides very precise control over
           how customization features are attached to individual
           declarations.   There are future expansion plans that will
           build upon this capability as well.

           It's not certain that %feature will ever be used directly
           by SWIG users.  Instead, it may be a low-level primitive
           that is used in high-level macro definitions.  For instance,
           to support properties, you might define a macro like this:

           %define %property(name, setf, getf)
           %feature("set") setf #name;
           %feature("get") getf #name;
           %enddef

           Which allows a user to specify things like this:

           %property(p, get_p, set_p);

           class Blah {
           public:
              int  get_p();
              void set_p(int);
           };

           *** EXPERIMENTAL NEW FEATURE ***
  
11/24/2001:beazley
           The Tcl module has been expanded with some new features for
           managing object ownership.  For example:
         
                set c [Circle -args 20]
                $c area             # Invoke a method
                $c -disown          # Releases ownership of the object
                $c -acquire         # Acquires ownership of the object

           If Tcl owns the object, its destructor is invoked when the 
           corresponding object command is deleted in Tcl.  

           To simplify the destruction of objects, the following syntax
           can be used:

                $c -delete         # Delete an object

           This is an alternative for the more obscure variant of 

                rename $c {}

           These features also add functionality at the C API level.
           The following functions manage ownership from C and
           can be used in typemaps.

                SWIG_Acquire(void *ptr);
                SWIG_Disown(void *ptr);

           A new function for constructing instances is also available:

                Tcl_Obj *
                SWIG_NewInstanceObj(Tcl_Interp *interp, void *ptr,
                                    swig_type_info *type, int own);

           When used in a typemap, this creates a pointer object and
           an interpreter command that can be used to issue methods and
           access attributes as shown above.

           All Python-related %pragma operations have been eliminated.
           Most of these were written for older SWIG versions in order to
           compensate for limitations in earlier releases.  In an effort
           to reduce the amount of code-clutter and potential for errors,
           it is easier to simply eliminate the pragmas and to start over
           (if needed).  To be honest, I'm not even sure the pragmas
           worked in 1.3.9 and recent releases.

           Note: If you need to insert code into the shadow class file
           created by SWIG, simply use the %shadow directive like this:

              %shadow %{
              def some_python_code():         
                  print "blah!"
              %}

11/22/2001:beazley
           Sweeping changes to the way in which the Python module handles
           shadow classes.   In early implementations, shadow classes were
           merely Python wrappers around typed pointer objects. However, 
           some users actually wanted to receive the shadow class object in C.
           To accommodate this, the dereferencing of the "this" pointer in
           a shadow class was moved to C as described in CHANGES [8/8/99].
           However, the process of returning pointers to Python was still
           somewhat problematic.  Specifically, shadow classes never worked
           in situations such as these:

             -   Use of any kind of output typemap ('out' or 'argout')
             -   Global variables (broken as far as I can tell).

           In the past, some users have dealt with this by manually trying
           to create shadow class objects themselves from C/C++.  However,
           this was difficult because the C wrappers don't really know how
           to get access to the corresponding Python class.

           The Python module has now been modified to automatically attach
           shadow class objects to pointers when they are returned to 
           Python.   This process occurs in the function SWIG_NewPointerObj()
           so the process is completely transparent to users.    As a result,
           shadow classes are now more seamlessly integrated with typemaps
           and other features of SWIG.

           This change may introduce a number of incompatibilities.  The
           SWIG_NewPointerObj() now takes an extra parameter "own" to 
           indicate object ownership.   This can be used to return a pointer
           to Python that Python should destroy.   In addition, older code
           that tries to manually construct shadow class objects or which
           expects bare pointers may break---such pointers may already be
           encapsulated by a shadow class.

           Modified the %insert directive to accept single braces { ... }.
           For example:

                %insert("header") {
                   ... some code ...
                }

           This works exactly like %{ ... %} except that the code in the
           braces is processed using the preprocessor.   This can be useful
           in certain contexts such as low-level code generation in 
           language modules.

11/20/2001:beazley
           Command line options are now translated into preprocessor
           symbols.  For example:
	
              ./swig -python -shadow -module blah interface.i

           Creates the symbols:

              SWIGOPT_PYTHON 1
              SWIGOPT_SHADOW 1
              SWIGOPT_MODULE blah

           if needed.

           Massive overhaul of the Perl5 module.  A lot of code generation is
           now driven by tables and typemaps.   The generated wrapper code 
           also makes use of tables to install constants, variables, and
           functions instead of inlining a bunch of procedure calls.  The
           separate variable initialization function is gone.   Most
           code generation is controlled via the perl5.swg file in the
           library.

11/13/2001:beazley
           Added parsing support for the C++ typename keyword.  Primarily this
           is added to better support templates.  For example:

             template<typename T> void  blah(C& v) {
                 typename C::iterator i = v.begin();
             }

           Note: typename is supported in the parser in the same way as 'struct'
           or 'class'.  You probably shouldn't use it anywhere except in templates.

11/11/2001:beazley
           Massive overhaul of the language module API.   Most functions now
           use a common, very simple,  API.   There are also a number of
           interesting semantic side-effects of how code is actually generated.
           Details will be forthcoming in Doc/Manual/Extending.html.

           Fixed a very subtle bug due to unnamed class wrapping. For example, if
           you did this

              typedef struct {
                  int x,y;
              } gdPoint, *gdPointPtr;

              void foo(gdPointPtr x);

           Then the foo function would get a type-error.   The problem has
           to do with internal typedef handling and the fact that the typedef
           declarations after the struct appear later in the parse tree.
           It should work now.  Problem reported by Vin Jovanovic.

11/09/2001:beazley
           Subtle change to "out" typemaps (and related variations).  The name
           that is attached to the typemap is now the raw C identifier that
           appears on a declaration.  This changes the behavior of
           member functions.  For example:

               %typemap(out) int foo {
                  ...
               }

               class Blah {
                   public:
                      int foo();    // typemap gets applied
               }
            
           Previous versions never really specified how this was supposed to
           work.  In SWIG1.1, you could probably write a typemap for the
           wrapper name like this:

                %typemap(out) int Blah_foo { ... }

           However, this old behavior is now withdrawn and not supported. 
           Just use the member name without any sort of special prefix.

           Changes to Tcl module initialization:

           (1) SWIG now automatically includes the code needed to work with
                Tcl stubs.  Simply compile with -DUSE_TCL_STUBS.

           (2) SWIG now automatically calls Tcl_PkgProvide to register
               a package name.  The package name is the same as the name
               specified with the %module directive.  The version number is
               set to "0.0" by default.  To change the version number, use
               swig -pkgversion 1.2 interface.i.

           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
           Modules that provided stubs and Tcl_PkgProvide on their own might
           break.  Simply remove that code.

11/05/2001:beazley
           Changed code generation of constants in the Tcl module.  Constants
           are now stored in a large table that get installed at module startup.
           There are also no longer any static variables so it should generate
           somewhat less code.

11/04/2001:beazley
           The "const" typemap has been renamed to "constant" in many language
           modules.  "const" is a C keyword which made the handling of the typemap
           directive somewhat awkward in the parser.
           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

11/04/2001:beazley
           %typemap directive can now accept nearly arbitrary keyword parameters.
           For example:

              %typemap(in,parse="i",doc="integer") int "...";

           The purpose of the keyword parameters is to supply code generation
           hints to the target language module.   The intepretation of the
           parameters is language specific.
           *** NEW FEATURE ***

11/04/2001:beazley
           Slight semantic change to internal call/return by value handling.
           In previous versions of SWIG, call-by-value was translated
           into pointers.  For example:

               double dot_product(Vector a, Vector b);

           turned into this:

               double wrap_dot_product(Vector *a, Vector *b) {
                  return dot_product(*a,*b);
               }

           This translation was normally performed by the SWIG core, outside
           of the control of language modules.  However, a side effect
           of this was a lot of bizarre typemap behavior.   For example,
           if you did something like this:

                %typemap(in) int32 {
                    ...
                }

           You would find that int32 was transformed into a pointer everywhere!
           (needless to say, such behavior is unexpected and quite awkward to
           deal with).  To make matters worse, if a typedef was also used,
           the pointer behavior suddenly disappeared.

           To fix this, the pointer transformation is now pushed to the
           language modules.   This produces wrappers that look roughly
           like this:

               double wrap_dot_product(Vector *a, Vector *b) {
                  Vector arg1 = *a;
                  Vector arg2 = *b;
                  return dot_product(arg1,arg2);
               }

           This change also makes it easy to define typemaps for
           arbitrary undefined types.  For example, you can do this (and it
           will work regardless what int32 is):

               %typemap(in) int32 {
                  $1 = (int32) PyInt_AsLong($input);
               }

           *** POTENTIAL IMCOMPATIBILITY ***
           This change may break call/return by value code generation in
           some language modules.

           Changed the name of the default typemaps to the following:

               %typemap() SWIGTYPE  { 
                   ... an object ...
               }
               %typemap() SWIGTYPE * {
                   ... a pointer ...
               }
               %typemap() SWIGTYPE & {
                   ... a reference ...
               }
               %typemap() SWIGTYPE [] {
                   ... an array ...
               }
               %typemap() enum SWIGTYPE {
                  ... an enum value ...
               }
               %typemap() SWIGTYPE (CLASS::*) {
                   ... pointer to member ...
               }


           These types are used as the default for all types that don't match
           anything else.  See CHANGES log entry for 8/27/2000 for the
           old behavior.  The role of these types is also described in

           the use of default arguments.   Note: from some inspection

10/16/2001:beazley
           Support for multivalued typemaps added.  The typemaps
           are specified using the syntax below.   Within each
           typemap, variable substitution is handled as follows:

              %typemap(in) (int argc, char *argv[]) {
                  $arg;  // The input object in the target language
                  $1;    // C local variable for first argument
                  $2;    // C local variable for second argument

                  // These variables refer to either argument
                  $1_type, $1_ltype, $1_basetype, etc...  (argc)
                  $2_type, $2_ltype, $2_basetype, etc...  (argv[])

                  // Array dimension of argv
                  $2_dim0
              }

           Basically any variable that was available in normal typemaps
           is available for either argument by prefacing the variable
           name by '$n_' where n is the argument position.

           Notes:  
           (1) Multi-valued typemaps can only be applied to a single
               object in the target scripting language.   For example,
               you can split a string into a (char *, int) pair or
               split a list into a (int, char []) pair.  It is not
               possible to map multiple objects to multiple arguments.

           (2) To maintain compatibility with older SWIG versions, the
               variables such as $target and $type are preserved and
               are mapped onto the first argument only.

           (3) This should not affect compatibility with older code.
               Multi-valued typemaps are an extension to typemap handling.
               Single valued typemaps can be specified in the usual
               way.

           The old $source and $target variables are officially
           deprecated.  Input variables are referenced through
           $arg$ and output values are reference through $result$.

           *** NEW FEATURE ***

10/16/2001:beazley
           Added parsing support for multivalued typemaps.  The syntax
           is a little funky, but here goes:

              // Define a multivalued typemap
              %typemap(in) (int argc, char *argv[]) {
                    ... typemap code ...
              }

              // Multivalued typemap with locals
              %typemap(in) (int argc, char *argv[])(int temp) {
                    ... typemap code ...
              }
              
              // Copy a multivalued typemap
              %typemap(in) (int argcount, char **argv) = (int argc, char *argv[]);

              // Apply a multivalued typemap
              %apply (int argc, char *argv[]) { (int argcount, char **argv) };

           Note: this extra parsing support is added for future extension.
           No language modules currently support multi-valued typemaps.

10/11/2001:beazley
           Modified the typemap matching code to discard qualifiers when
           checking for a match.   For example, if you have a declaration
           like this:

                 void blah(const char *x);

           The typemap checker checks for a match in the following order:

                 const char *x
                 const char *
                 char *x
                 char *

           If typedef's are involved, qualifier stripping occurs before
           typedef resolution.  So if you had this,

                typedef char *string;
                void blah(const string x);

           typemap checking would be as follows:

                const string x
                const string
                string x
                string
                const char *x
                const char *
                char *x
                char *

           The primary reason for this change is to simplify the implementation
           of language modules.  Without qualifier stripping, one has to write
           seperate typemaps for all variations of const and volatile (which
           is a pain).

           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***  Typemaps might be applied in
           places where they weren't before.


10/9/2001: beazley
           SWIG now generates wrappers that properly disambiguate
           overloaded methods that only vary in constness.  For
           example:

               class Foo {
                  ...
                  void blah();
                  void blah() const;
                  ...

           To handle this, the %rename directive can be used normally.
           
               %rename(blah_const) blah() const;

           In the resulting wrapper code, method calls like this
           are now generated:

               (obj)->blah()               // Non-const version
               ((Foo const *)obj)->blah()  // const version

           This should force the right method to be invoked.
           Admittedly, this is probably obscure, but we might
           as well get it right.

           The preprocessor now ignores '\r' in the input.

           However, at this time, constants using these operators
           are not supported (the parser will issue a warning).

           *** NEW FEATURE ***

10/4/2001: beazley
           Change to semantics of %template directive.  When
           using %template, the template arguments are handled
           as types by default.  For example:

                %template(vecint) vector<int>;
                %template(vecdouble) vector<double>;

           To specify a template argument that is *not* a type, you
           need to use default-value syntax. For example:

                %template(vecint) vector<int,int=50>;
                %template(vecdouble) vector<int,size=100>;

           In this case, the type name doesn't really matter--only
           the default value (e.g., 50, 100) is used during
           expansion.  This differs from normal C++, but I couldn't
           figure out a better way to do it in the parser.  Might
           implement an alternative later.
           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
       
10/4/2001: beazley
           Major changes to template handling in order to provide
           better integration with the C++ type-system. The main
           problem is as follows:

           Suppose you have a template like this:

              template<class T> void blah(const T x) { stuff };
                   
           Now suppose, that you instantiate the template on a
           type like this in SWIG:

              %template(blahint) blah<int *>;

           In C++, this is *supposed* to generate code like this:

              void blah(int *const x) { stuff };

           However, in SWIG-1.3.9, the template substitution gets it wrong
           and produces

              void blah(const int *x) { stuff };

           (notice the bad placement of the 'const' qualifier).

           To fix this, the SWIG parser now generates implicit typedefs
           for template type arguments that produces code roughly
           equivalent to doing this:

              typedef int *__swigtmpl1;
              %template(blahint) blah<__swigtmpl1>;

           which generates code like this:

              void blah(const __swigtmpl1 x) { stuff };

           Since this is correct in both C++ and SWIG, it provides the right
           semantics and allows everything to compile properly.  However,
           to clean up the generated code a little bit, the parser keeps
           track of the template types and performs back-substitution to
           the original type when building the parse tree.  Thus, even
           though the implicit typedef is used in the input and may appear
           in the generated wrapper file (for proper compilation), the parse
           tree will hide a lot of these details.   For example:

              void blah(const __swigtmpl1 x) { stuff };

           will look like it was declared as follows (which is what
           you want):

              void blah(int *const x) { stuff }

           The only place you are likely to notice the typedef hack
           is in bodies of template functions.  For example, if you
           did this,

              template<class T> class blah {
                   ...
                   %addmethods {
                       void spam() {
                          T  tempvalue;
                          ...
                       }
                   }
              }

           you will find that 'T tempvalue' got expanded into some
           strange typedef type.  This *still* compiles correctly 
           so it's not a big deal (other than looking kind of ugly
           in the wrapper file).

10/4/2001: beazley
           Fixed some inheritance problems in Tcl Object interface.

10/1/2001: beazley
           Tcl module has changed to use byte-backed pointer strings.  This
           implementation should be safe on 64-bit platforms.  However,
           the order in which digits appear in pointer values no longer
           directly corresponds to the actual numerical value of a
           pointer (on little-endian machines, pairs of digits appear
           in reverse order).

10/1/2001: beazley
           Perl5 module is now driven by a configuration file 'perl5.swg'
           in the SWIG library.

10/1/2001: beazley
           The perl5 module no longer tries to apply the "out" typemap
           in code generated for magic variables.  I'm surprised that
           this ever worked at all (since all of the code that was there
           was wrong anyways).   Use the "varout" typemap to handle
           global variables.

10/1/2001: beazley
           Fixed a bug related to character array members of structures.
           For example:

                struct Foo {
                   char name[32];
                };

           SWIG is normally supposed to return a string, but this was
           broken in 1.3.9.   The reason it was broken was actually
           due to a subtle new feature of typemaps.  When a data member
           is set to an array like this, the return type of the related
           accessor function is actually set to an array.  This means
           that you can now write typemaps like this:

              %typemap(python,out) char [ANY] {
                 $target = PyString_FromStringAndSize($source,$dim0);
              }

           This functionality can be used to replace the defunct
           memberout typemap in a more elegant manner.

9/29/2001: beazley
           Some further refinement of qualified C++ member functions.
           For example:

               class Foo {
                  ...
                  void foo() const;
                  ...
               };

           (i) The SWIG parser was extended slightly to allow 'volatile'
           and combinations of 'const' and 'volatile' to be used.  This
           is probably rare, but technically legal.  Only added for
           completeness.

           (ii) For the purposes of overloading, qualified and non-qualified
           functions are different.  Thus, when a class has methods like this:

                 void foo();
                 void foo() const;

           Two distinct methods are declared.  To deal with this, %rename
           and similar directives have been extended to recognize const.
           Thus, one can disambiguate the two functions like this:

                %rename(fooconst) Foo::foo() const;

           or simply ignore the const variant like this:

                %ignore Foo::foo() const;

           Note: SWIG currently has no way to actually invoke the const
           member since the 'const' is discarded when generating wrappers
           for objects.  

9/27/2001: beazley
           New directive. %namewarn can be used to issue warning
           messages for certain declaration names.   The name
           matching is the same as for the %rename directive.
           The intent of this directive is to issue warnings for
           possible namespace conflicts.  For example:

              %namewarn("print is a python keyword") print;

           The name matching algorithm is performed after a name
           has been resolved using %rename.  Therefore, a
           declaration like this will not generate a warning:

              %rename("Print") print;
              ...
              void print();    /* No warning generated */

           Since the warning mechanism follows %rename semantics, it is
           also to issue warnings for specific classes or just for
           certain member function names.

           (Dave - I've been thinking about adding something like this
           for quite some time.  Just never got around to it)
           *** NEW FEATURE ***


9/27/2001: beazley
           Enhanced the %ignore directive so that warning messages
           can be issued to users.   This is done using %ignorewarn
           like this:

             %ignorewarn("operator new ignored") operator new;

           The names and semantics of %ignorewarn is exactly the 
           same as %ignore. The primary purpose of this directive
           is for module writers who want to ignore certain types
           of declarations, but who also want to alert users about it.
           A user might also use this for debugging (since messages
           will appear whenever an ignored declaration appears).
           *** NEW FEATURE ***

9/26/2001: beazley
           Super-experimental support for overloaded operators. 
           This implementation consists of a few different parts.

           (i) Operator names such as 'operator+' are now allowed
           as valid declarator names.  Thus the 'operator' syntax
           can appear *anyplace* a normal declarator name was used
           before.  On the surface, this means that operators can
           be parsed just like normal functions and methods. 
           However, it also means that operator names can be used
           in many other SWIG directives like %rename.  For example:

            %rename(__add__) Complex::operator+(const Complex &);

           (ii) Operators are wrapped *exactly* like normal functions
           and methods.  Internally, the operator name is used 
           directly meaning that the wrapper code might contain
           statements like this:

                arg0->operator*((Complex const &)*arg1);

           This all seems to parse and compile correctly (at least
           on my machine).

           (iii) SWIG will no longer wrap a declaration if its symbol
           table name contains illegal identifier characters.  If
           illegal characters are detected, you will see an error
           like this:
 
                Warning. Can't wrap operator* unless renamed to a valid identifier.

           The only way to fix this is to use %rename or %name to bind
           the operator to a nice name like "add" or something. Note:
           the legal identifier characters are determined by the target
           language.

           There are certain issues with friend functions and operators.
           Sometimes, friends are used to define mixed operators such
           as adding a Complex and a double together.  Currently, SWIG
           ignores all friend declarations in a class.  A global operator
           declaration can probably be made to work, but you'll have to
           rename it and it probably won't work very cleanly in the
           target language since it's not a class member.

           SWIG doesn't know how to handle operator specifications 
           sometimes used for automatic type conversion. For example:

           class String {
              ...
              operator const char*();
              ...
           };

           (this doesn't parse correctly and generates a syntax error).

           Also: operators no longer show up as separate parse-tree
           nodes (instead they are normal 'cdecl' nodes).  I may
           separate them as a special case later.

           See Examples/python/operator for an example.

==================================

9/25/2001: beazley
           Fixed parsing problem with type declarations like 
           'char ** const'.  SWIG parsed this correctly, but the
           internal type was represented incorrectly (the pointers
           and qualifiers were in the wrong order).

           Fixed SF Bug [ #462354 ] %import broken in 1.3.7.

9/20/2001: beazley

           Parser modified to ignore out-of-class constructor
           and destructor declarations.  For example:

               inline Foo::Foo() :
                    Bar("foo")
               { 
               } 

               inline Foo::~Foo() {
               }

           Suggested by Jason Stewart.
           *** EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE ***

9/20/2001: beazley

           Incorporated changes to make SWIG work with ActivePerl.  
           Contributed by Joel Reed.

9/20/2001: beazley
           Slight change to the parsing of C++ constructor initializers.
           For example:

           class Foo : public Bar {
           public:
                  Foo() : Bar(...) {...}
           };

           SWIG now discards the contents of the (...) regardless of 
           what might enclosed (even if syntactically wrong).  SWIG
           doesn't need this information and there is no reason to
           needless add syntax rules to handle all of the possibilities
           here.

9/20/2001: beazley
           Change to typemaps for structure members.  If you have a
           structure like this:

              struct Vector {
                int *bar;
              };

           The member name 'bar' is now used in any accessor functions.
           This allows the "in" typemap to be used when setting the value.
           For example, this typemap

               %typemap(python,in) int *bar {
                   ...
               }

           now matches Vector::bar.  It should be noted that this will also
           match any function with an argument of "int *bar" (so you should
           be careful).

           Fixed problem with default arguments and class scope.  For
           example:

               public:
                  enum bar { FOO, BAR };
                  void blah(bar b = FOO);
                  ...
               }

           SWIG now correctly generates a default value of "Foo::FOO" for
           the blah() method above.  This used to work in 1.1, but was
           broken in 1.3.7.   Bug reported by Mike Romberg.

Version 1.3.7  (September 3, 2001)
==================================

9/02/2001: beazley
           Added special %ignore directive to ignore declarations.  This
           feature works exactly like %rename.  For example:

             %ignore  foo;        // Ignore all declarations foo
             %ignore  ::foo;      // Only ignore foo in global scope
             %ignore  Spam::foo;  // Only ignore in class Spam
             %ignore  *::foo;     // Ignore in all classes

           %ignore can also be parameterized.  For example:

             %ignore foo(int);
             %ignore ::foo(int);
             %ignore Spam::foo(int);

           that use it.  It's also been added to make the SWIG type
           system more complete.
           *** NEW FEATURE ***

8/30/2001: beazley
           Added support for parameterized %rename directive.  *** This
           new feature can be used to greatly simplify the task of
           resolving overloaded methods and functions. ***
           
           In prior versions of SWIG, the %rename directive was
           used to consistently apply an identifier renaming. For 
           example, if you said this:

                %rename foo bar;

           Every occurrence of 'foo' would be renamed to 'bar'. 
           Although this works fine for resolving a conflict with a
           target language reserved word, it is useless for
           for dealing with overloaded methods.    This is because
           all methods are simply renamed to the same thing 
           (generating the same conflict as before).

           Therefore, the only way to deal with overloaded methods
           was to go through and individually rename them all using
           %name.  For example:

             class Foo {
             public:
                 virtual void bar(void);
                 %name(bar_i) virtual void bar(int);
                 ...
             };

           To make matters worse, you had to do this for all
           derived classes too.

             class Spam : public Foo {
             public:
                 virtual void bar(void);
                 %name(bar_i) virtual void bar(int);
                 ...
             };

           Needless to say, this makes it extremely hard to resolve
           overloading without a lot of work and makes it almost
           impossible to use SWIG on raw C++ .h files.

           To fix this, %rename now accepts parameter declarators.
           The syntax has also been changed slightly.  For example,
           the following declaration renames all occurrences of 'bar(int)'
           to 'bar_i', leaving any other occurrence of 'bar' alone.

             %rename(bar_i) bar(int);

           Using this feature, you can now selectively rename 
           certain declarations in advance.  For example:

             %rename(bar_i) bar(int);
             %rename(bar_d) bar(double);

             // Include raw C++ header    
             %include "header.h"

           When %rename is used in this manner, all occurrence of bar(int)
           are renamed wherever they might occur.  More control is obtained
           through explicit qualification. For example,

              %rename(bar_i) ::bar(int);

           only applies the renaming if bar(int) is defined in the global scope.
           The declaration,
     
              %rename(bar_i) Foo::bar(int);

           applies the renaming if bar(int) is defined in a class Foo.
           This latter form also supports inheritance.  Therefore, if you
           had a class like this:

               class Spam : public Foo {
               public:
                   void bar(int);
               }

           The Spam::bar(int) method would also be renamed (since Spam 
           is a subclass of Foo).   This latter feature makes it easy
           for SWIG to apply a consistent renaming across an entire
           class hierarchy simply by specifying renaming rules for
           the base class.

           A class wildcard of * can be used if you want to renaming
           all matching members of all classes.  For example:

              %rename(bar_i) *::bar(int);

           will rename all members bar(int) that are defined in classes.
           It will not renamed definitions of bar(int) in the global
           scope.

           The old use of %rename is still supported, but is somewhat
           enhanced.  

              %rename(foo) bar;      // Renames all occurrences of 'bar'.
              %rename(foo) ::bar;    // Rename all 'bar' in global scope only.
              %rename(foo) *::bar;   // Rename all 'bar' in classes only.
              %rename(foo) Foo::bar; // Rename all 'bar' defined in class Foo.

           *** NEW FEATURE ***

8/30/2001: beazley
           Added support for data-member to member-function 
           transformation.  For example, suppose you had a
           structure like this:

                struct Vector {
                    double x,y;
                };

           Now suppose that you wanted to access x and y 
           through a member function interface instead 
           of the usual SWIG behavior. For example:

              f.set_x(3.4)      # instead of f.x = 3.4
              x = f.get_x()     # instead of x = f.x

           To do this, simply use the new %attributefunc
           directive.  For example:

              %attributefunc(get_%s,set_%s)
              struct Vector {
                 double x,y;
              };
              %noattributefunc

           The arguments to %attributefunc are C-style printf
           format strings that determine the naming convention
           to use.  %s is replaced with the actual name of the
           data member. SWIG provides a number of printf
           extensions that might help.  For example, if you
           wanted to title case all of the attributes, you
           could do this:

              %attributefunc(get%(title)s,set%(title)s);

           This will turn an attribute 'bar' to 'getBar()' and 'setBar()'.

           (someone requested this long ago, but I finally figured
           how to implement it in a straightforward manner).
           *** EXPERIMENTAL NEW FEATURE ***
           
8/30/2001: beazley
           SWIG now automatically generates default constructors
           and destructors if none are defined.  This used to be
           enabled with a command line switch -make_default, but
           most people want these functions anyways.  To turn
           off this behavior use the -no_default option or include
           the following pragma in the interface file:
 
                 %pragma no_default;
  
           This may break certain interfaces that defined their
           own constructors/destructors using the same naming
           convention as SWIG.  If so, you will get duplicate
           symbols when compiling the SWIG wrapper file.
           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

8/29/2001: beazley
           Changes to Perl5 shadow class code generation.  Iterators
           are no longer supported (FIRSTKEY, NEXTKEY).  Also, attribute
           access has been changed to rely on inheritance in order
           to provide better behavior across modules.  

8/28/2001: beazley
           Various obscure improvements to the type system and classes.
           Strange declarations like this are now wrapped correctly
           (i.e., the generated wrapper code doesn't cause the C++
            compiler to die with a type error).

            class Foo {
            public:
                 typedef double Real;
                 Real foo(Real (*op)(Real,Real), Real x, Real y);
            };

           Inheritance of types is also handled correctly.
           
8/28/2001: beazley
           Changes to class wrappers.   When SWIG sees two classes like this,
 
           class X {
           public:
             void foo();
             ...
           }
 
           class Y : public X {
           public:
             void bar();
             ...
           }
 
           it now only generates two wrapper functions:
 
             X_foo(X *x) { x->foo(); }
             Y_bar(Y *y) { y->bar(); }
 
           Unlike SWIG1.15, the foo() method does *not* propagate to a wrapper
           function Y_foo(). Instead, the base class method X_foo() must be
           used.

           This change should not affect modules that use shadow classes, but
           it might break modules that directly use the low-level C wrappers.
           This change is being made for a number of reasons:

               -  It greatly simplifies the implementation of SWIG--especially
                  with anticipated future changes such as overloaded methods.

               -  It results in substantially less wrapper code--especially
                  for big C++ class hierarchies (inherited declarations
                  are no longer copied into every single derived class).

               -  It allows for better code generation across multiple
                  SWIG generated modules (code isn't replicated in
                  every single module).

           modules yet).

8/19/2001: beazley
           Added limited parsing and full type-system support for pointers to
           members. None of SWIG's language modules really know how to deal with
           this so this is really only provided for completeness and future
           expansion.  Note: SWIG does not support pointers to members which 
           are themselves pointers to members, references to pointers to members,
           or other complicated declarations like this.
           *** NEW FEATURE ***

8/19/2001: beazley
           SWIG is much better at parsing certain C++ declarations. Operators and
           friends generally don't cause anymore syntax errors.  However, neither
           are really supported.

8/18/2001: beazley
           Added *highly* experimental support for wrapping of C++
           template declarations.  Since C++ templates are essentially
           glorified macros and SWIG has a fully operational C 
           preprocessor with macro support, the parser now converts
           template declarations to macros.  For example, a function
           template like this

               template<class T> T max(T a, T b);

           is internally converted into a macro like this:

               %define %_template_max(__name,T)
               %name(__name) T max(T a, T b);
               %enddef

           To instantiate a version of the template, a special %template declaration
           is used like this:

               %template(maxint) max<int>;          
               %template(maxdouble) max<double>;

           The parameter to the %template directive must be proper C identifier that's
           used to uniquely name the resulting instantiation.   When used, the
           the expanded macro looks like this:

              %name(maxint) int max(int a, int b);
              %name(maxdouble) double max(double a, double b);

           A similar technique is used for template classes.   For instance:

              template<class T> class vector {
                 T *data;
                 int sz;
              public:
                 vector(int nitems);
                 T *get(int n);
                 ...
              };

           Gets converted into a macro like this:

              %define %_template_vector(__name, T)
              %{
              typedef vector<T> __name;
              %}
              class __name {
                 T *data;
                 int sz;
              public:
                 __name(int nitems);
                 T *get(int n);
                 ...
              };
              typedef __name vector<T>;
              %enddef

           An a specific instantiation is created in exactly the same way:

             %template(intvec) vector<int>;

           The resulting code parsed by SWIG is then:

              %{
              typedef vector<int> intvec;
              %}
              class intvec {
                  int *data;
                  int sz;
              public:
                  intvec(int nitems);
                  int *get(int n);
                  ...
              };
              typedef intvec vector<int>;

           Note: the last typedef is non-standard C and is used by SWIG to provide
           an association between the name "intvec" and the template type 
           "vector<int>".

           CAUTION:  This is an experimental feature and the first time SWIG has
           supported C++ templates.   Error reporting is essential non-existent.
           It will probably break in certain cases.
           *** EXPERIMENTAL NEW FEATURE ****

8/15/2001: beazley
           Change to wrapping of multi-dimensional arrays.  Arrays
           are now properly mapped to a pointer to an array of
           one less dimension.  For example:

                int [10];              -->  int *
                int [10][20];          -->  int (*)[20];
                int [10][20][30];      -->  int (*)[20][30];

           This change may break certain SWIG extensions because
           older versions simply mapped all arrays into a single
           pointer such as "int *".   Although possibly unusual, 
           the new version is correct in terms of the C type system.

           Many improvements to Tcl/Perl/Python modules to better
           work with multiple interface files and the %import directive.

8/13/2001: beazley
           Fixed up the behavior of %import in the Python module.
           SWIG no longer pollutes the module namespace by using
           'from module import *' to refer to the other module. 
           Instead, it does a proper 'import module'.   Also, SWIG
           may work a lot better when importing modules that include
           references to other imported modules.

8/13/2001: mkoeppe
	   Added new typemap substitutions, generalizing those of the
	   Guile-specific 5/27/2001 changes: 
	   * $descriptor is the same as SWIGTYPE$mangle, but also
	     ensures that the type descriptor of this name gets
	     defined.
	   * $*type, $*ltype, $*mangle, $*descriptor are the same as
	     the variants without star, but they REMOVE one level of
	     pointers from the type. (This is only valid for pointer 
	     types.)
	   * $&type, $&ltype, $&mangle, $&descriptor are the same as
	     the variants without ampersand, but they ADD one level of
	     pointers to the type.
	   The Guile-specific substitution $basedescriptor was removed
	   because it was useless.

           The %extern directive is now deprecated and withdrawn.  The
           purpose of this directive was to import selected definitions
           from other interface files and headers.  However, the same
           functionality is better handled through %import.   This
           leaves SWIG with two file inclusion directives:

              %include filename     - Inserts into current interface
              %import filename      - Import types and classes from 
                                      another module

           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

8/09/2001: beazley
           Added new support for wrapping C/C++ callback functions. 
           A common problem with some C libraries is that many
           functions take a function pointer as an argument. For example:

              int do_op(..., int (*op)(int,int), ...);

           Unfortunately, the only way to call such a function is to
           pass it a function pointer of some compatible type.  In
           previous versions of SWIG, you had to solve this problem
           with some really gross hacks.  For example, if you wanted to
           use the following function as a callback,

               int foo(int, int);

           you had to install a pointer to it as a constant.  For example:

               %constant int (*FOO)(int,int) = foo;

           or 

               const int (*FOO)(int,int) = foo;

           or if you had a really old SWIG version:

               typedef int (*OP_FUNC)(int,int);
               int do_op(..., OP_FUNC, ...);
               const OP_FUNC FOO = foo;

           
           Now, you can do one of two things:

               %constant int foo(int,int);

           This creates a constant 'foo' of type int (*)(int,int).
           Alternatively, you can do this:

               %callback("%s");
               int foo(int,int);
               int bar(int,int);
               %nocallback;

           In this case, the functions are installed as constants where
           the name is defined by the format string given to %callback().
           If the names generated by the format string differ from the
           actual function name, both a function wrapper and a callback 
           constant are created.  For example:

               %callback("%(upper)s");
               int foo(int,int);
               int bar(int,int);
               %nocallback;
           
           Creates two wrapper functions 'foo', 'bar' and additionally
           creates two callback constants 'FOO', 'BAR'.

           Note: SWIG still does not provide automatic support for 
           writing callback functions in the target language.
           *** NEW FEATURE ***

8/06/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
           * struct nesting fixes as per SF bug #447488.

8/03/2001: beazley
           The %name directive now applies to constants created with
           #define and %constant.  However, most language modules
           were never written to support this and will have to be
           modified to make it work.  Tcl, Python, and Perl modules
           are working now.
           *** NEW FEATURE ***

8/03/2001: beazley
           Massive changes and simplification of C declaration parsing.
           Although SWIG is still not a full C parser, its ability
           to handle complex datatypes including pointers to functions
           and pointers to arrays has been vastly improved.  

8/03/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
           * Distribution fixes: autoconf no longer needed to install SWIG.

8/02/2001: beazley
           Removed two undocumented parsing features.  SWIG no longer
           supports out-of-class static function or variable
           declarations.  For example:

                static int Foo::bar;

           This feature may return if there is sufficient demand. 
           However, since SWIG is most often used with header files,
           it is more likely for these definitions to be included
           in the class definition.
           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

8/02/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   * Cleanup of the GIFPlot examples. Upgraded Java GIFPlot example.

8/01/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   * [Java] Efficiency changes: _cPtr used where possible rather than
	     getCPtr(). Bug fixes for inheritance - derived class sometimes
	     didn't delete the c memory when _delete() was called.
	   * [Java] Abstract c++ classes are wrapped with a java abstract shadow
	     class. Also a pure virtual function is mapped with an abstract method.
	   * The default output file has always been <module>_wrap.c. It is now
	     <module>_wrap.cxx if the -c++ commandline option is passed to swig.
	     This has been done as otherwise c++ code would appear in a c file.
           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY *** 

7/31/2001: beazley
           Modified the %constant directive to be more C-like in syntax.
           The syntax is now:

                %constant NAME = VALUE;
                %constant TYPE NAME = VALUE;
 
           For example:

                %constant Foo *Bar = &Spam;

           A more subtle case is as follows:

               %constant int (*FOO)(int,int) = blah;

           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***  Modules that were using
           the %constant directive directly will need to be modified.
      
7/30/2001: beazley
           Removed obscure and undocumented form of the %inline directive:

               %inline int blah(int a, int b) {
                  ...
               }

           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY *** 
           (note: this feature was never documented and is withdrawn)

7/30/2001: beazley
           Removed support for functions with no explicitly declared
           return type.  For example:

                  foo(int);

           In C, such functions were implicitly assumed to return an 'int'.
           In C++, this is illegal.  Either way, it's considered bad
           style.  Removing support for this in SWIG will simplify
           certain issues in parsing.
           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

7/30/2001: mkoeppe
	   * Partial merge from the CVS trunk.  The Source/DOH directory
	     and most of the Source/Swig directory is up-to-date now.
	   * [Guile] %scheme is now a macro for %insert("scheme").  
	     New syntax:  %scheme "FILENAME"; 
	     New syntax:  %scheme %{ SCHEME-CODE %}
	     New macros %multiple_values, %values_as_list,
	     %values_as_vector. 

7/29/2001: beazley
           %readonly and %readwrite have been turned into SWIG pragmas.
           %pragma(swig) readonly and %pragma(swig) readwrite.  Macros
           are used to provide backwards compatibility.

7/29/2001: beazley
           Minor changes to %pragma directive.  %pragma must always
           be directed to a specific language.  For example:

              %pragma(swig) make_default;
              %pragma(perl5) include = "blah.i";

           Also extended the pragma directive to allow code blocks
 
              %pragma(foo) code = %{
                  ... some code ...
              %}

           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

7/29/2001: beazley
           Change to the way 'const' variables are wrapped.  In 
           previous versions of SWIG, a 'const' variable was
           wrapped as a constant.   Now, 'const' variables are
           wrapped as read-only variables.  There are several
           reasons for making this change, mostly pertaining to
           subtle details of how 'const' actually works. 

           This will probably break old interfaces that used 'const'
           to create constants.   As a replacement, consider using this:

           const int a = 4;   ===>   %constant int a = 4;
           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

7/29/2001: beazley
           Reorganization and simplification of type parsing.
           Types with 'const' should work correctly now.

7/29/2001: beazley
           Most swig directives related to the documentation system
           are now deprecated.

7/29/2001: beazley
           Removed support for Objective-C in order to simplify
           parser reconstruction.  Will return if there is sufficient
           demand.
           *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

7/29/2001: beazley
           Code inclusion has been modified in the parser.  A common
           directive %insert is now used for everything.  This
           inserts a file into the output:

               %insert(header) "foo.swg"

           This inserts some inline code into the output

               %insert(header) %{
                   ... some code ... 
               %}

           There are five predefined targets for the insert directive:

               "header"    - Header section of wrapper file
               "runtime"   - Runtime section of wrapper file
               "wrapper"   - Wrapper section
               "init"      - Initialization function
               "null"      - Nothing. Discard.

           The following directives are still supported, but are
           now defined in terms of macros:

               %{ ... %}           -> %insert(header)  %{ ... %}
               %init %{ ... %}     -> %insert(init)    %{ ... %}
               %wrapper %{ ... %}  -> %insert(wrapper) %{ ... %}
               %runtime %{ ... %}  -> %insert(runtime) %{ ... %}

           Language modules can define new named targets by using the
           C API function Swig_register_filebyname() (see main.cxx).
           For example, if you wanted to expose a shadow class file,
           you could do this:

              Swig_register_filebyname("shadow", f_shadow);

           Then in the interface file:

              %insert(shadow) %{ ... %}

           Note: this change should not affect any old interfaces, but
           does open up new possibilities for enhancements.

7/29/2001: beazley
           SWIG now always includes a standard library file 'swig.swg'.
           This file defines a large number of macro definitions
           that define the behavior of various SWIG directives.
           Previously, all SWIG directives were handled as special
           cases in the parser.  This made the parser a large 
           bloated mess.  Now, the parser is stripped down to a few
           simple directives and macros are used to handle everything else.

7/26/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   * Fixes for Sourceforge bug #444748 - new testcase cpp_static:
	     [TCL] Class with just static member variable/function fix
	     [Java] Fixed static variables support
	     [Ruby] Static variables workaround removed

7/27/2001: mkoeppe
	   * stype.c (SwigType_default): Strip qualifiers first. The
	     default type of "int * const" is now "SWIGPOINTER *".
	   * main.cxx: Define "__cplusplus" in SWIG's preprocessor if
	     in C++ mode.
	   * [Guile]: Added some support for arrays and C++
	     references, fixing the "constant_pointers" test case.
	   * Moved most tests from the old Guile-specific test-suite
	     to the new test-suite.  Also moved perl5/pointer-cxx
	     example there.

7/26/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   * Test-suite added.
	   * Initial testcases: constant_pointers cpp_enum defines
	     sizeof_pointers unions virtual_destructor
	   * Make clean improvements.

7/24/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   * [Java] Underscores in the package name and/or module name
	   no longer give linking problems.

7/17/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   * More parser bug fixes for constant pointers

7/19/2001: mkoeppe
	   * [Guile] Aesthetic improvement in variable wrappers.

7/18/2001: beazley
           * Fixed core-dump problem in pointer library when 
             freeing character arrays.
             SF Bug [ #415837 ] pointer lib core dump

7/18/2001: beazley
           * Fixed problem with default destructors and shadow
             classes.  SF bug #221128.

7/18/2001: beazley
           * To provide better line-number tracking in interfaces
             with lots of macros, special locator comments are
             now generated by the SWIG preprocessor.  For example:

                 /*@foo.i,42,BLAH@*/expanded macro/*@@*/

             The first /*@...@*/ sequence sets the context
             to point to the macro code.  The /*@@*/ comment
             terminates the context.  The SWIG parser should
             ignore all of the locator comments as should
             the C compiler (should such comments end up
             in generated wrapper code).

7/18/2001: mkoeppe
	   * The parser now handles severely constified types in
	   typemaps.  This introduced a new shift/reduce conflict, but
	   only with a heuristic function-pointer catch-all rule.  
	   * [Guile]: Added typemaps for severely constified types. 
	   * Fixed the "template-whitespace" problem by canonicalizing
	     whitespace, especially around angle brackets and commas. 

7/17/2001: mkoeppe
	   * [Guile]: A Scheme file is emitted if the -scmstub FILE.SCM
	   command-line option is used.  The %scheme directive
	   (implemented as a macro for a pragma) allows to insert
	   arbitrary code here.  In "simple" and "passive" linkage,
	   the file gets filled with define-module and export
	   declarations.

7/17/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   * Parser bug fix to support constant pointers, eg int* const ptr.
	   Fixed everywhere - variables, parameters, return types etc. Note that
	   when wrapping a constant pointer variable only the getter is generated.

7/17/2001: mkoeppe
	   * Fixed SF bug #441470 (#define X "//" would not be parsed,
	     see test-suite entry "preproc-1"), reported by T. W. Burton
	     <twburton@users.sf.net>.
	   * Changed the type of character constants to "char", rather
	     than "char *".  Changed the individual language modules
	     to keep the old behaviour, except for the Guile module,
	     where it is desired to make them Scheme characters.  This
	     fixes SF bug #231409, test-suite entry "char-constant".
	   * Applied patch for DOH/Doh/memory.c by Les Schaffer
	     <schaffer@optonline.net> (avoid required side effects in
	     assert). 

7/17/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   * Bug fix in parser for virtual destructor with void as parameter
	   * Bug fix in parser #defines embedded within classes/structs/unions
	   Consequently %constant can now also be placed within a struct/class/union.
	   * Bug fix in parser to allow sizeof(*I_am_a_pointer) within a #define

7/16/2001: mkoeppe
	   * Added changes for the Macintosh contributed by Luigi
	   Ballabio <ballabio@mac.com>. 
	   * Some "const" fixes in the code.
	   * [Guile]: Made the constant-wrapper functions much shorter.

7/13/2001: mkoeppe
	   * [Guile]: Some "const" fixes for Guile version 1.3.4.
	   * Handle anonymous arguments with default values and static
	     array members of classes.  Both bugs reported by Annalisa Terracina
	     <annalisa.terracina@datamat.it>; see the files
	     Examples/guile/test-suite/static-array-member.i and
	     anonymous-arg.i.

Version 1.3.6  (July 9, 2001)
=============================

7/09/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   * GIFPlot examples: FOREGROUND and BACKGROUND definition missing 
	   after TRANSPARENT #define fix in GIFPlot

7/03/2001: beazley
           Fixed up the version numbers so that the release is known
           as 1.3.6.  All future releases should have a similar
           version format.

7/02/2001: mkoeppe
	   * [Python]: Prevent the problem of self.thisown not being
	   defined if the C++ class constructor raised an exception.
	   Thanks to Luigi Ballabio <ballabio@mac.com>.

6/29/2001: mkoeppe
	   * More portability fixes; fixed "gcc -Wall" warnings.

6/29/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   * GIFPlot examples: TRANSPARENT #define multiple times on Solaris 
	   (clashes with stream.h).
	   * Multiple definition bug fix for shadow classes. The perl and python 
	   modules had workarounds which have been replaced with fixes in 
	   the core. Many of the Language::cpp_xxxx functions now set a 
	   flag which the derived classes can access through 
	   is_multiple_definition() to see whether or not code should be 
	   generated.  The code below would have produced varying degrees 
	   of incorrect shadow class code for the various modules:
	   class TestClass
	   {
	   public:
	     TestClass() {}
	     TestClass(int a) {}
	     ~TestClass() {}
	     unsigned long xyz(short k) {}
	     unsigned long xyz(int n) {}
	     static void static_func() {}
	     static void static_func(int a) {}
	   };
	   void delete_TestClass(int a);

6/27/2001: mkoeppe
	   * [Perl] Another const-related portability fix.

6/26/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   * [Java] Added in cpp_pragma() support with a host of new pragmas - see 
	   jswig.html. These are designed for better mixing of Java and c++. It 
	   enables the user to specify pure Java classes as bases and/or interfaces 
	   for the wrapped c/c++.
	   * [Java] Old pragmas renamed. Warning given for the moment if used.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR JAVA MODULE ***

6/25/2001: mkoeppe
	   * Incorporated more build changes contributed by Wyss Clemens
	   <WYS@helbling.ch> for swig/ruby on cygwin.

6/20/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   * Makefile mods so that 'make check' uses the swig options in the makefiles
	   * [Java] Removed Generating wrappers message
	   * [Java] NULL pointer bug fix
	   * [Java] Bug fix for Kaffe JVM

6/20/2001: mkoeppe
	   * SWIG_TypeQuery from common.swg now returns a
	   swig_type_info* rather than a void*.  This fixes a problem
	   when using pointer.i and C++, as illustrated by the new
	   test-suite example perl5/pointer-cxx.
	   * Portability fixes (const char *). 
	   * Incorporated build changes contributed by Wyss Clemens
	   <WYS@helbling.ch>, which make swig runnable on cygwin.

6/19/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   * [Java] Bug fix for SF bug #211144. This fix is a workaround 
	     until fixed in the core.

6/19/2001: mkoeppe
	   * [Guile]: Portability fixes for use with the Sun Forte
	   compilers. 
	   * [Tcl]: Portability fix (const char *).
	   * [Tcl]: Configure now first tries to find a tclConfig.sh
	   file in order to find the Tcl include directory, library
	   location and library name.
	   * [Python]: Added a few possible library locations.

6/18/2001: mkoeppe
	   * [Guile]: Don't call scm_c_export if nothing is to be
	     exported.  Don't warn on %module if module has been set
	     already (this frequently occurs when %import is used).

6/16/2001: mkoeppe
	   * [Guile]: New "passive" linkage, which is appropriate for
	     multi-module extensions without Guile module magic.

6/15/2001: mkoeppe
	   * [Guile]: Fixed printing of smobs (space and angle were
	     missing). 
	   * Properly generate type information for base classes
	     imported with the %import directive.  Thanks to Marcelo
	     Matus <mmatus@acms.arizona.edu> for the report and the
	     patch; this closes SF bug #231619; see also
	     Examples/guile/test-suite/import*. 
	   * [Guile]: Fix casting between class and base class; the
	     runtime type system had it the wrong way around; see
	     Examples/guile/test-suite/casts.i
	   * Make typemaps for SWIGPOINTER * with arg name take
	     precedence over those without arg name, to match normal
	     typemap precedence rules.
	   * Fixed the random-line-numbers problem reported as SF bug
	     #217310; thanks to Michael Scharf <scharf@users.sf.net>.
	   * [Guile]: Handle the %name and %rename directives.
	   * New syntax: %name and %rename now optionally take double
	     quotes around the scripting name.  This is to allow scripting
	     names that aren't valid C identifiers.

6/14/2001: beazley
           Made a minor change to the way files are loaded in
           order to get file/line number reporting correct in
           the preprocessor.

6/14/2001: mkoeppe
	   * The parser now understands the (non-standard) "long long"
	     types. It is up to the individual language modules to
	     provide typemaps if needed. Reported by Sam Steingold, SF
	     bug #429176.
	   * The parser now understands arguments like "const int *
	     const i". This fixes SF bug #215649.
	   * Fixed the Guile test-suite.

6/13/2001: mkoeppe
	   Partial merge from the CVS trunk at tag
	   "mkoeppe-merge-1". This covers the following changes:

| 01/16/01: ttn
|	   Wrote table of contents for Doc/engineering.html.  Added section
|	   on CVS tagging conventions.  Added copyright to other docs.
| 9/25/00 : beazley
| 	   Modified the preprocessor so that macro names can start with a '%'.
| 	   This may allow new SWIG "directives" to be defined as macros instead
| 	   of having to be hard-coded into the parser.  
|
| *** Also a yet-to-be-documented quoting mechanism with backquotes
| *** has been implemented?

6/13/2001: mkoeppe
	 * When configure does not find a language, don't use default
	   paths like /usr/local/include; this only causes build
	   problems.
	 * New directory: Examples/Guile/test-suite, where a few
	   bugs in 1.3a5 are demonstrated. 
	 * Handle C++ methods that have both a "const" and a "throw"
	   directive (see Examples/Guile/test-suite/cplusplus-throw.i); 
	   thanks to Scott B. Drummonds for the report and the fix. 
	 * Handle C++ pointer-reference arguments (like "int *& arg") 
	   (see Examples/Guile/test-suite/pointer-reference.i,
	   reported as SF bug #432224).
	 * [Ruby] Fixed typo in rubydec.swg; thanks to Lyle Johnson!
	 * Don't stop testing when one test fails.
	 * [Guile, MzScheme] Don't print "Generating wrappers...".

6/12/2001: mkoeppe
	   [Guile] VECTORLENINPUT and LISTLENINPUT now have separate
	   list length variables. TYPEMAP_POINTER_INPUT_OUTPUT
	   attaches argument documentation involving SCM_TYPE to the
	   standard pointer typemaps. INOUT is now an alias for BOTH.

6/12/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   Some Java documentation added.
	   [Java] Fixed bugs in import pragma and shadow pragma. 

6/12/2001: mkoeppe
	   Fix declarations of SWIG_define_class
	   (Lib/ruby/rubydec.swg) and SWIG_TypeQuery
	   (Lib/common.swg). Thanks to Lyle Johnson
	   <ljohnson@resgen.com> for the patches.

6/11/2001: mkoeppe
	   [Guile] Use long instead of scm_bits_t; this makes the
	   generated wrapper code compatible with Guile 1.3.4
	   again. Thanks to Masaki Fukushima for pointing this out.

6/11/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   The generic INSTALL file from autoconf added. Few changes to README file.

6/11/2001: mkoeppe
	   Fixed typo in Makefile.in; thanks to Greg Troxel
	   <gdt@ir.bbn.com>. 

6/08/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   make check works again. Examples/GIFPlot configure generated by
	   top level autoconf now.

6/08/2001: mkoeppe
	   Another build change: The new script autogen.sh runs
	   autoconf in the appropriate directories.  The top-level
	   configure also configures in Examples/GIFPlot.

6/07/2001: mkoeppe
	   Made the Makefile work with non-GNU make again.

6/07/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   [Java] Class/struct members that are arrays of pointers to classes/structs -
	   Shadow class's get/set accessors now use Java classes instead of longs (pointers).
	   [Java] Shadow classes will now clean up memory if function return type 
	   is a class/struct.
	   [Java] New example called reference based on the same example from other modules.

6/06/2001: mkoeppe
	   New configure option --with-release-suffix allows for
	   attaching a suffix to the swig binary and the swig runtime
	   libraries.  Minor changes to the build system.  "swig
	   -swiglib" works again.  If invoked with the new option
	   "-ldflags", SWIG prints a line of linker flags needed to
	   link with the runtime library of the selected language
	   module. 

6/06/2001: mkoeppe
	   [Guile] gswig_list_p is an int, not a SCM.  This typo
	   caused warnings when compiling with a Guile configured with
	   strict C type checking. In INPUT and BOTH typemaps
	   generated by the SIMPLE_MAP macro, use the SCM_TO_C
	   function to convert from Guile to C (rather than C_TO_SCM).
	   Use scm_intprint to print pointers (rather than
	   sprintf). Allow using "-linkage" instead of "-Linkage". 

6/05/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   [Java] Mods for using inherited c++ classes from Java
	   [Java] New example called class based on the same example from other modules

6/05/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   [Java] destructor (_delete()) was not aware of %name renaming
	   [Java] extends baseclass did not know about %name renaming
	   [Java] extends baseclass did extend even when the baseclass was not known to swig
	   [Java] sometimes enum-declarations occurred before the Java class declaration
	   [Java] unrelated enum initialisations no longer appear in Java class
	   [Java] if module ends in '_' correct JNI names are now produced

6/04/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   [Java] Shadow class mods - Modified constructor replaces
	   newInstance(). _delete() now thread safe. getCPtr() replaces
	   _self. _selfClass() removed as now redundant. 
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR JAVA MODULE ***

	   [Java] Not all output java files had SWIG banner. New banner.

	   [Java] Shadow class finalizers are output by default: Command
	   line option -finalize deprecated and replaced with -nofinalize.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY FOR JAVA MODULE ***

6/ 1/2001: mkoeppe
	   [Guile] Cast SCM_CAR() to scm_bits_t before shifting it.
	   This is required for compiling with a Guile configured with
	   strict C type checking.  

6/ 1/2001: mkoeppe
	   Added configure option "--with-swiglibdir".

5/31/2001: mkoeppe
	   [Guile] Support multiple parallel lists or vectors in
	   the typemaps provided by list-vector.i.  New typemaps file,
	   pointer-in-out.i. 

5/25/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   [Java] HTML update for examples.

5/28/2001: mkoeppe
	   Minor changes to the build system.  Added subdirectory for
	   Debian package control files.

5/28/2001: mkoeppe
	   [Guile] Build a runtime library, libswigguile.

5/28/2001: mkoeppe
	   [Guile] New typemap substitution $*descriptor.  Use the {}
	   syntax, rather than the "" syntax for the standard
	   typemaps, in order to work around strange macro-expansion
	   behavior of the SWIG preprocessor.  This introduces some
	   extra braces.

5/27/2001: mkoeppe
	   [Guile] Handle pointer types with typemaps, rather than
	   hard-coded. New typemap substitutions $descriptor,
	   $basedescriptor; see documentation. Some clean-up in the
	   variable/constants wrapper generator code.  New convenience
	   macro SWIG_Guile_MustGetPtr, which allows getting pointers
	   from smobs in a functional style.  New typemap file
	   "list-vector.i", providing macros that define typemaps for
	   converting between C arrays and Scheme lists and vectors.

5/25/2001: cheetah (william fulton)
	   [Java] STL string moved into its own typemap as it is c++ code and 
	   it break any c code using the typemaps.i file.
	   - Fixes for wrappers around global variables - applies to primitive 
	   types and user types (class/struct) and pointers to these.
	   - Structure member variables and class public member variables getters 
	   and setters pass a pointer to the member as was in 1.3a3 and 1.1 
	   (1.3a5 was passing by value)
	   - Parameters that were arrays and return types were incorrectly 
	   being passed to create_function() as pointers.
	   - Fix for arrays of enums. 
	   [Java] Updated java examples and added two more.
	   [Java] Java module updated from SWIG1.3a3 including code cleanup etc.
	   [Java] enum support added.
	   [Java] Array support implemented
	   [Java] Shadow classes improved - Java objects used rather than 
	   longs holding the c pointer to the wrapped structure/c++class

5/22/2001: mkoeppe
	   [Guile] Fixed extern "C" declarations in C++ mode. Thanks
	   to Greg Troxel <gdt@ir.bbn.com>.

5/21/2001: mkoeppe
	   [Guile] New linkage "module" for creating Guile modules for
	   Guile versions >= 1.5.0. 

4/18/2001: mkoeppe
	   [MzScheme] Added typemaps for passing through Scheme_Object
	   pointers. 

4/9/2001 : mkoeppe 
	   [MzScheme] Added typemaps for `bool'.  Inclusion of headers
	   and support routines is now data-driven via mzscheme.i.
	   Headers come from the new file mzschemdec.swg.  Don't abort
	   immediately when a type-handling error is reported.  When
	   searching for typemaps for enums, fall back to using int,
	   like the Guile backend does.  Support char constants.  Emit
	   correct wrapper code for variables.

3/12/2001: mkoeppe
	   [Guile] Fixed typemaps for char **OUTPUT, char **BOTH.

3/2/2001 : mkoeppe 
	   [Guile] Every wrapper function now gets a boolean variable
	   gswig_list_p which indicates whether multiple values are
	   present. The macros GUILE_APPEND_RESULT, GUILE_MAYBE_VALUES
	   and GUILE_MAYBE_VECTOR use this variable, rather than
	   checking whether the current return value is a list. This
	   allows for typemaps returning a list as a single value (a
	   list was erroneously converted into a vector or a
	   multiple-value object in this case).

3/1/2001 : mkoeppe
	   [Guile] Added support for returning multiple values as
	   vectors, or passing them to a muliple-value
	   continuation. By default, multiple values still get
	   returned as a list.

3/1/2001 : mkoeppe
	   [Guile] Added a "beforereturn" pragma. The value of this
	   pragma is inserted just before every return statement.

3/1/2001 : mkoeppe
	   [Guile] Added support for Guile 1.4.1 procedure
	   documentation formats, see internals.html.

2/26/2001: mkoeppe
	   [Guile] Made the wrapper code compile with C++ if the
	   "-c++" command-line switch is given.  Thanks to
	   <monkeyiq@dingoblue.net.au>. 

2/26/2001: mkoeppe
	   [Guile] Now two type tables, swig_types and
	   swig_types_initial, are used, as all other SWIG language
	   modules do.  This removes the need for the tricky
	   construction used before that the broken Redhat 7.0 gcc
	   doesn't parse. Reported by <monkeyiq@dingoblue.net.au>. 

2/26/2001: mkoeppe
	   [Guile] Fixed typemaps for char *OUTPUT, char *BOTH; a bad
	   free() would be emitted.  Added typemap for SCM.


Version 1.3 Alpha 5 
===================

9/19/00 : beazley
          [Python] Python module generates more efficient code for
          creating the return value of a wrapper function. Modification
          suggested by Jon Travis.

9/19/00 : beazley
          Library files specified with the -l option are now included at the
          end of the interface file (reverting to the old behavior).

9/19/00 : beazley
          Fixed some problems with enum handling.  enums are now manipulated as
          'int', but cast into the enum type when values are passed to the 
          corresponding C function.

9/19/00 : mkoeppe
	  [Guile] Removed "-with-smobs" command-line option, as this is the
	  default now.  Added "-emit-setters" command-line option,
	  which turns on generating procedures-with-setters; see
	  internals.html.

9/18/00 : mkoeppe
	  Incorporated patch #101430, fixing bugs in the Guile module: 
	  1. Some arguments were erroneously taken as *optional* arguments when
	     ignored arguments were present. 
	  2. Guile 1.3.4 was not supported since functions introduced in Guile
	      1.4 were used.	  
	  3. Added handling of `const char *'.

9/17/00 : beazley
          Fixed problem with failed assertion and large files.

9/17/00 : beazley
          Fixed problem with the '%' character appearing in added methods
          and function bodies.  Preprocessor bug.

Version 1.3 Alpha 4 (September 4, 2000)
=======================================

9/3/00  : ttn
          Added instructions for maintainers in Examples/README on how
          to make examples also be useful in the testing framework.
          Also, "make check" now uses ./Lib by via env var `SWIG_LIB'.
          This is overridable like so:
             make chk-swiglib=/my/experimental/swig/Lib check

9/3/00  : beazley
          Added $typemap variable to typemaps.  This gets replaced with
          a string indicating the typemap that is applied.  Feature
          request from rsalz.

9/3/00  : beazley
          Experimental optimization to code generation for virtual
          member functions.  If you have two classes like this:

                 class A() {
                   virtual void foo();
                 }

                 class B() : public A {
                   virtual void foo();
                 }

          Swig now will generate a single wrapper function for this

                A_foo(A *a) {
                    a->foo();
                }

          and use it as the implementation of both A_foo() and B_foo().
          This optimization only takes place if both methods are declared
          as virtual and both take identical parameters.
          *** EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE ***

9/3/00  : beazley
          Restored the "memberin" typemap for setting structure members.
          Unlike the old version, the new version is expanded inline in the
          wrapper function allowing access to scripting language
          internals (a sometimes requested feature). The "memberout" typemap
          is gone. Use the "out" typemaps instead.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

9/3/00  : beazley
          Attribute set methods no longer return the value of a member.
          For example:

               struct Foo {
                    int x;
                    ...
               }

          now gets set as follows:

              void Foo_x_set(Foo *f, int x) {
                    f->x = x;
              }

          In SWIG1.1 it used to be this:

              int Foo_x_set(Foo *f, int x) {
                   return (f->x = x);
              }

          This has been changed due to the complexity created by trying
          to do this with more exotic datatypes such as arrays.  It also
          complicates inlining and handling of the "memberin" typemap.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

9/2/00  : beazley
          Removed the ptrcast() and ptrmap() functions from the
          pointer.i library file.  Old implementation is incompatible
          with new type system.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

9/2/00  : beazley
          New runtime function SWIG_TypeQuery(const char *name) added.
          This function can be used to extract the type info structure
          that is used for type-checking.  It works with either the
          nice C name or mangled version of a datatype.  For example:

              swig_type_info *ty = Swig_TypeQuery("int *");
              swig_type_info *ty = Swig_TypeQuery("_p_int");

          This is an advanced feature that has been added to support some
          exotic extension modules that need to directly manipulate
          scripting language objects.
          *** NEW FEATURE ***

9/2/00  : beazley
          New directive %types() added.  This is used to
          explicitly list datatypes that should be included in
          the runtime type-checking code. Normally it is never
          necessary to use this but sometimes advanced extensions
          (such as the pointer.i library) may need to manually
          add types to the type-checker.
          *** NEW FEATURE ***

8/31/00 : beazley
          Improved handling of string array variables. For example,
          a global variable of the form "char name[64]" is automatically
          managed as a 64 character string.  Previously this didn't
          work at all or required the use of a special typemap.
          *** NEW FEATURE (Tcl, Perl, Python) ***

8/31/00 : ttn
	  Added Makefile target `check-c++-examples', which uses new
	  files under Examples/C++ contributed by Tal Shalif.  Now "make
	  check" also does "make check-c++-examples".  Also, expanded
	  actions in `check-gifplot-example' and `check-aliveness'.

8/30/00 : mkoeppe
	  Major clean-up in the Guile module. Added typemap-driven
	  documentation system. Changed to handle more than 10
	  args. Updated and extended examples.
	  *** NEW FEATURE ***

8/29/00 : beazley
          Added new %insert directive that inserts the contents of a file
          into a portion of the output wrapper file.  This is only intended
          for use by writers of language modules.  Works as follows:

               %insert(headers)  "file.swg";
               %insert(runtime)  "file.swg";
               %insert(wrappers) "file.swg";
               %insert(init)     "file.swg";

          *** NEW FEATURE ***

8/29/00 : beazley
          Added new %runtime directive which includes code into the runtime
          portion of the wrapper code. For example:

              %runtime %{
                    ... some internal runtime code ...
              %}

          There is no practical reason for ordinary users to use this
          feature (almost everything can be done using %{ ... %}
          instead).   However, writers of language modules may want to
          use this in language configuration files.
          *** NEW FEATURE ***

8/28/00 : beazley
          Typemaps can now be specified using string literals like
          this:

              %typemap(in) int "$target = SvIV($source);";

          When code is specified like this, it is *NOT* enclosed
          inside a local scope (as with older typemap declarations).
          Note: character escape sequences are interpreted in the
          code string so if you want to include a quote or some
          other special character, make sure you use a (\).
          *** NEW FEATURE ***

8/27/00 : beazley
          Typemaps have been modified to follow typedef declarations.
          For example, if you have this:

              typedef int Number;

              %typemap(in) int {
                      ... get an integer ...
              }

              void foo(Number a);

          The typemap for 'int' will be applied to the argument 'Number a'.
          Of course, if you specify a typemap for 'Number' it will take
          precedence (nor will it ever be applied to an 'int').
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

8/27/00 : beazley
          Default typemap specification has changed.   In older
          versions of swig, you could do this:

               %typemap(in) int SWIG_DEFAULT_TYPE {
                   ...
               }

          To specify the default handling of a datatype.   Now that
          SWIG follows typedef declarations, this is unnecessary.
          Simply specifying a typemap for 'int' will work for all
          variations of integers that are typedef'd to 'int'.

          Caveat, specifying the default behavior for pointers,
          references, arrays, and user defined types is a little
          different.  This must be done as follows:

               %typemap() SWIGPOINTER * {
                      ... a pointer ...
               }
               %typemap() SWIGREFERENCE & {
                      ... a reference ...
               }
               %typemap() SWIGARRAY [] {
                      ... an array ...
               }
               %typemap() SWIGTYPE {
                      ... a user-defined type (by value) ...
               }
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

8/15/00 : dustin
          The file swig-1.3a1-1.spec has been added to the Tools directory.
          It can be used to build a redhat package for SWIG, although it
          will need to be updated for the next public release.

8/15/00 : beazley
          Typemaps have been completely rewritten.  Eventually they may be
          replaced with something better, but for now they stay.  However,
          there are a number of a significant changes that may trip some
          people up:

          1.  Typemap scoping is currently broken.  Because of this, the
              following code won't work.

              %typemap(in) blah * {
                   ...
              }
              class Foo {
                   ...
                   int bar(blah *x);
              }
              %typemap(in) blah *;   /* Clear typemap */

              (this breaks because the code for the class Foo is actually
              generated after the entire interface file has been processed).
              This is only a temporary bug.

          2.  In SWIG1.1, the %apply directive worked by performing a
              very complex type-aliasing procedure.  From this point on,
              %apply is simply a generalized typemap copy operation.
              For example,

                  %apply double *OUTPUT { double *x, double *y };

              Copies *ALL* currently defined typemaps for 'double *OUTPUT' and
              copies them to 'double *x' and 'double *y'.

              Most people probably won't even notice this change in
              %apply.  However, where it will break things is in code like
              this:

                  %apply double *OUTPUT { double *x };
                  %typemap(in) double *OUTPUT {
                       ... whatever ...
                  }

                  void foo(double *x);

              In SWIG1.1, you will find that 'foo' uses the 'double *OUTPUT' rule
              even though it was defined after the %apply directive (this is
              the weird aliasing scheme at work).  In SWIG1.3 and later,
              the 'double *OUTPUT' rule is ignored because it is defined
              after the %apply directive.

          3.  The %clear directive has been modified to erase all currently
              defined typemaps for a particular type.  This differs from
              SWIG1.1 where %clear only removed rules that were added using
              the %apply directive.

          4.  Typemap matching is now performed using *exact* types.
              This means that things like this

                   %typemap(in) char * { }
                   %typemap(in) const char * { }

              are different typemaps.    A similar rule applies for pointers,
              arrays, and references.  For example:

                   %typemap(in) double * { }

              used to apply to 'double &', 'double []',  Now, it only applies
              to 'double *'.  If you want a 'double &', you'll need to handle
              that separately.

          5.  Array matching has been simplfied.  In SWIG1.1, array matching
              was performed by trying various combinations of dimensions.
              For example, 'double a[10][20]' was matched as follows:

                   double [10][20]
                   double [ANY][20]
                   double [10][ANY]
                   double [ANY][ANY]

              In SWIG1.3, only the following matches are attempted:

                   double [10][20]
                   double [ANY][ANY]

          On the positive side, typemap matching is now *significantly* faster
          than before.

          Secret developer feature.  Since datatypes are now represented as 
          strings internally, you can bypass limitations of the parser and
          create a wild datatype by simply enclosing the raw string encoding
          in backticks (``) and sticking it in the interface file anywhere a
          type is expected.  For example, `a(20).a(10).p.f(int,int)`.  This 
          feature is only intended for testing (i.e., you want to see what
          happens to your language module if it gets a reference to a pointer
          to an array of pointers to functions or something). 
          *** SICK HACK ***

8/14/00 : beazley
          Completely new type-system added to the implementation.
          More details later.

8/11/00 : beazley
          Cleaned up some of the I/O handling.  SWIG no longer generates
          any temporary files such as _wrap.wrap, _wrap.ii, _wrap.init.
          Instead, these "files" are kept around in memory as strings
          (although this is transparent to language modules).

8/4/00  : ttn
	  Added Makefile target "check" and variants.
	  This can be used like "make check" or, to explicitly skip a
	  language LANG: "make skip-LANG=true check".  LANG is skipped
	  automatically if ./configure determines that LANG support is
	  insufficient.

	  Currently, the check is limited to doing the equivalent of
	  "make all" in some of the Examples directories.  This should
	  be expanded both horizontally (different types of tests) and
	  vertically (after "make all" in an Examples subdir succeeds,
	  do some additional tests with the resulting interpreter, etc).

8/4/00  : ttn
	  Added Makefile target "distclean", which deletes all the
	  files ./configure creates, including config.status and friends.

8/3/00  : harcoh
	  java changes??? [todo: document changes]

7/23/00 : beazley
          Typemaps have been modified to key off of the real datatypes
          used in the interface file.  This means that typemaps for
          "const char *" and "char *" will be difference as will typemaps
          for "Vector" and "Vector *."
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
          This is likely to break interfaces that rely on the odd type
          handling behavior of typemaps in SWIG1.1--especially with
          respect to interfaces involving pass-by-value.

7/23/00 : beazley
          New %constant directive.  This directive can be used to
          create true constants in the target scripting language.
          It's most simple form is something like this:

             %constant FOO 42;

          In this case, the type is inferred from the syntax of the
          value (in reality, all #define macros are translated into
          directives of this form).

          An expanded version is as follows:

            %constant(Foo *) FOO = &FooObj;

          In this case, an explicit type can be specified.  This
          latter form may be useful for creating constants that
          used to be specified as

             const Foo *FOO = &FooObj;

          (which are now treated as variables).
          *** EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE *** The syntax may change in
          the final release.

7/23/00 : beazley
          Modified the parser so that variable declarations of the form
          "const type *a" are handled as variables, not constants.
          Note: SWIG1.1 handled this case erroneously because
          const char *a is a pointer variable that can be reassigned.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
          Note: just because this is the "right" way to do things,
          doesn't mean it's the most appropriate interpretation.
          I suspect that many C programmers might use 'const char *'
          with the intent of creating a constant, without realizing
          that they've created a reassignable global variable.

7/23/00 : beazley
          The C/C++ wrapping layer has been completely redesigned and
          reimplemented.  This change should iron out a few rough
          spots with the handling of datatypes.  In addition, the
          wrapper code is somewhat cleaner.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
          This change may break interfaces that involve
          subtle corner-cases with typemaps and the %addmethods
          directive since some of these features had somewhat
          type handling behavior in SWIG1.1.

7/23/00 : beazley
          The "memberin" and "memberout" typemaps are gone for the
          moment, but they might return as soon as I figure out
          how to integrate them with some of the streamlined C wrapper
          functions.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

7/22/00 : beazley
          A variety of old type handling functions such as print_type(),
          print_full(), print_mangle(), etc... are gone and have been
          replaced with a smaller set of functions.  See the file
          Doc/internals.html for details.  This will break all third
          party language modules.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

7/20/00 : beazley
          Deprecated the %val and %out directives.  These directives
          shouldn't really be necessary since typemaps can be used
          to achieve similar results.   This also cleans up the
          handling of types and parameters quite a bit.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

7/20/00 : ttn
	  Fixed unspecified-module bug in Guile support and removed

          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

7/9/00  : beazley
          Implementation of SWIG no longer makes use of C++ operator overloading.
          This will almost certainly break *all* third party language modules

          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

7/8/00  : beazley
          Removed the experimental and undocumented "build" typemap that

          to keep around.  Besides, a better replacement is in the works.

7/6/00  : ttn
          Removed non-"with-smobs" functionality (Guile support), i.e.,
          "-with-smobs" is now the default and no longer needs to be
	  specified on the command-line.

7/5/00  : ttn

6/27/00 : beazley
          Rewrote some of the string handling and eliminated the C++
          implementation (which is now just a wrapper).

6/27/00 : ttn
          Added Doc/index.html and Doc/internals.html.  The target
          audience for the latter is new SWIG developers.


Version 1.3 Alpha 3 (June 18, 2000)
===================================

6/18/00 : beazley
          Removed the naming.cxx, hash.cxx, and symbol.cxx files from
          the SWIG1.1 directory.   Continued to migrate things away
          from the C++ base (although there's still a lot of work to do).

6/17/00 : beazley
          Added a few more examples to the Examples directory.  Still
          need to do a lot of work on this.

6/16/00 : beazley
          Added -includeall to follow all #include statements in the
          preprocessor.

6/15/00 : beazley
          Tried to fix as many C++ warnings as possible when compiling
          with the Sun Workshop C++ compiler.  Unfortunately, this means
          that there are a lot of statements that contain string literals
          of the form (char*)"Blah".

6/15/00:  beazley
          A variety of cleanup and performance optimization in the
          low-level DOH library.   This seems to result in a speedup
          of 50-100% for preprocessing and other related tasks.

5/10/00 : ttn
	  Applied variable-wrapping bugfix patch contributed
	  by Matthias Koeppe.

4/17/00 : ttn
	  Updated MzScheme support contributed by Oleg Tolmatcev.
	  We now use a `Scheme_Type'-based structure to wrap pointers.

4/11/00 : ttn
	  Incorporated further Guile-support patch by Matthias Koeppe.
	  Typemaps previously deleted have been re-added.  There is now
	  exception handling (see Doc/engineering.html).  `SWIG_init' is now
	  declared extern only for simple linkage.  Some bugs were fixed.

4/06/00 : ttn
	  Incorporated MzScheme support contributed by Oleg Tolmatcev.
	  This includes new directories Lib/mzscheme and Examples/mzscheme.

4/03/00 : ttn
	  Added Examples/guile and children.  This is an adaptation of
	  the same-named directory from the SWIG-1.1p5 distribution.
	  Added Guile-specific section to Doc/engineering.html.

4/02/00 : ttn
	  Incorporated new guilemain.i by Martin Froehlich.
	  Incorporated Guile-support rewrite patch by Matthias Koeppe.
	  The command line option "-with-smobs" enables implementation of
	  pointer type handling using smobs, the canonical mechanism for
	  defining new types in Guile.  Previous implementation (using
	  strings) is at the moment still supported but deprecated.  At
	  some point, "-with-smobs" will be the default and no longer
	  required.

3/13/00 : beazley
          Added purify patches submitted by Ram Bhamidipaty.

3/02/00 : ttn
          Added support for different Guile "linkage" schemes.
	  Currently, "-Linkage hobbit" works.


Version 1.3 Alpha 2 (March 1, 2000)
===================================

2/29/00 : beazley
          Made SWIG ignore the 'mutable' keyword.

2/29/00 : beazley
          Incorporated some patches to the Perl5 module related to
          the -hide option and the destruction of objects.
          Patch submitted by Karl Forner.

2/27/00 : ttn
	  Incorporated Guile support contributed by Matthias Koeppe.
	  This includes a cpp macro in Lib/guile/guile.swg and the
	  entire file Lib/guile/typemaps.i.

2/25/00 : ttn
	  Modified configure.in and Makefile.in files to support
	  non-local build (useful in multi-arch environments).

2/24/00 : ttn
	  Incorporated Guile support contributed by Clark McGrew.
	  This works with Guile 1.3, but since it depends heavily
	  on the gh_ interface, it should work for all later versions.
	  It has not been tested with versions before 1.3.
	  WARNING: Code is unstable due to experimentation by ttn.

2/16/00 : beazley
          A variety of performance improvements to the Python shadow
          class code generation.  Many of these result in substantial
          runtime performance gains.  However, these have come at
          a cost of requiring the use of Python 1.5.2.  For older
          versions, use 'swig -noopt -python' to turn off these
          optimization features.

Version 1.3 Alpha 1 (February 11, 2000)
=======================================

2/11/00 : Added 'void' to prototype of Python module initializer.
          Reported by Mark Howson (1/20/00).

2/11/00 : beazley
          Modified the Python shadow class code to discard ownership of an
          object whenever it is assigned to a member of another object.
          This problem has been around for awhile, but was most recently
          reported by Burkhard Kloss (12/30/99).

2/11/00 : beazley
          Added braces around macros in the exception.i library.  Reported
          by Buck Hodges (12/19/99)

2/11/00 : beazley
          Fixed bug in the constraints.i library. Reported by Buck
          Hodges (12/14/99)

2/11/00 : beazley
          The %native directive now generates Tcl8 object-style command calls.
          A full solution for Tcl7 and Tcl8 is still needed. Patch suggested
          by Mike Weiblen (11/29/99)

2/11/00 : beazley
          Modified the typemap code to include the $ndim variable for arrays.
          Patch provided by Michel Sanner (11/12/99).

2/11/00 : beazley
          Modified the Python module to raise a Runtime error if an attempt
          is made to set a read-only member of a shadow class.  Reported by
          Michel Sanner (11/5/99).

2/10/00 : The documentation system has been removed. However, it is likely
          to return at some point in the future.

2/1/00  : Added a number of performance enhancements to the Python shadow
          classing and type-checking code.  Contributed by Vadim Chugunov.

          1. Remove _kwargs argument from the shadow wrappers when -keyword
             option is not specified. This saves us a construction of keyword
             dictionary on each method call.

             def method1(self, *_args, **_kwargs):
                 val = apply(test2c.PyClass1_method1, (self,) + _args, _kwargs)
                 return val

             becomes

             def method1(self, *_args):
                 val = apply(test2c.PyClass1_method1, (self,) + _args)
                 return val

          2. Incorporate self into the _args tuple.  This saves at least one tuple
             allocation per method call.

             def method1(self, *_args):
                 val = apply(test2c.PyClass1_method1, (self,) + _args)
                 return val

             becomes

             def method1(*_args):
                 val = apply(test2c.PyClass1_method1, _args)
                 return val

          3. Remove *Ptr classes.
             Assume that we are SWIGging a c++ class CppClass.
             Currently SWIG will generate both CppClassPtr class
             that hosts all methods and also CppClass that is derived
             from the former and contains just the constructor.
             When CppClass method is called, the interpreter will try
             to find it in the CppClass's dictionary first, and only then
             check the base class.

             CppClassPtr functionality may be emulated with:

             import new
             _new_instance = new.instance
             def CppClassPtr(this):
                  return _new_instance(CppClass, {"this":this,"thisown":0})

             This saves us one dictionary lookup per call.

             <DB>The new module was first added in Python-1.5.2 so it
             won't work with older versions.  I've implemented an
             alternative that achieves the same thing</DB>

          4. Use CObjects instead of strings for pointers.

          Dave: This enhancements result in speedups of up to 50% in some
          of the preliminary tests I ran.

2/1/00  : Upgraded the Python module to use a new type-checking scheme that
          is more memory efficient, provides better performance, and
          is less error prone. Unfortunately, it will break all code that
          depends on the SWIG_GetPtr() function call in typemaps.
          These functions should be changed as follows:

                if (SWIG_GetPtr(string,&ptr,"_Foo_p")) {
                    return NULL;
                }

          becomes

                if (SWIG_ConvertPtr(pyobj, &ptr, SWIG_TYPE_Foo_p) == -1) {
                    return NULL;
                }

          Note: In the new implementation SWIG_TYPE_Foo_p is no longer
          a type-signature string, but rather an index into a type
          encoding table that contains type information.

1/12/00 : beazley
          Revoked the %ifdef, %ifndef, %endif, %if, %elif, and %else

          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

1/12/00 : beazley
          Moved the documentation modules from the SWIG directory
          to the Modules directory (where they really should have been
          to begin with).

1/12/00 : beazley
          Removed the -stat option for printing statistics. The
          statistics reporting was inadequate and mostly broken
          anyway.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

1/12/00 : beazley
          Removed the -t option for reading a typemap file.  More

          suffix for its output file instead of .doc.

1/11/00 : beazley
          Added the long-lost SWIG preprocessor back to the system.
          It should be enabled by default.  Raw preprocessed output
          can be viewed using swig -E file.i.
          *** NEW FEATURE ***

1/11/00 : beazley and djmitche
          Completely reorganized the SWIG directory structure.  The
          basic organization is now:

                Lib/            SWIG library files (swig_lib)
                Doc/            Documentation

12/08/99: Loic Dachary (loic@senga.org)
	  Enhanced package handling for perl5 and c++.

	  With new option -hide Foo::Bar, every perl5 object (Frob) is
	  qualified by Foo::Bar::Frob. The package name is solely used
	  to encapsulate C/C++ wrappers output in <module>_wrap.c and the
	  corresponding perl package in <module>.pm. Note that a package
	  name may contain :: (Frob::Nitz) and will be relative to the
	  package name provided by -hide (Foo::Bar::Frob::Nitz).

	  In *_wrap.c, SWIG_init macro is used. Was previously defined
	  but not used and simplifies code.

	  Added typemap(perl5,perl5in) and typemap(perl5,perl5out) that
	  do the equivalent of typemap(perl5,in) and typemap(perl5,out)
	  but contain perl code and applies to wrappers generated by
	  -shadow.

	  Lacking proper regression tests I used
	  Examples/perl5/{c++,constraint,defarg,except,
	  graph/graph[1234],multinherit,nested,shadow,simple,tree,
	  typemaps/{argv,argv2,arraymember,database,file,ignore,integer,
	  output,passref,reference,return}}/. I ran swig with and without
	  the patches, diff the generatedsources, run the .pl files
	  and checked that the results are identical. In all those examples
	  I had no error.

11/21/99: Modified the Tcl module to provide full variable linking capabilities
          to all datatypes.   In previous versions, a pair of accessor functions
          were created for datatypes incompatible with the Tcl_LinkVar() function.
          Now, we simply use variable traces to support everything. This may
          break scripts that rely upon the older behavior.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

11/21/99: Added slight tweak to wrapper generator to collect local variables
          of similar type.  Produces somewhat more compact wrapper code.

11/20/99: Modified the Tcl module to use SWIG_GetArgs() to parse
          arguments.    This is a technique borrowed from Python in which
          arguments are converted using a format string convention similiar
          to fprintf().   This results in a *substantial* reduction in the
          size of the resulting wrapper code with only a modest runtime overhead
          in going through the extra conversion function.

11/13/99: Completely rewrote the class/structure generation code for the
          Tcl module.  Now, a small set of runtime functions are used
          to implement the functionality for all classes (instead of a
          massive amount of runtime code being generated for each class).
          Class specific information is simply encoded in a series of
          static tables.   This results in a *HUGE* reduction in wrapper
          code size--especially for C++.

11/13/99: Removed the -tcl (Tcl 7.x) module.  Tcl 8.0 is now several
          years old and the defacto standard--no real reason to keep
          supporting the old version at this point.

11/13/99: Cleaned up -c option for Python module.  The pyexp.swg file
          is now gone.

11/13/99: Fixed external declarations to work better with static linking
          on Windows.  Static linking should now be possible by defining
          the -DSTATIC_LINK option on the command line.  Patch contributed
          by Alberto Fonseca.

11/5/99 : Fixed an obscure code generation bug related to the generation
          of default constructors.   Bug reported by Brad Clements.

11/5/99 : Fixed a few memory problems found by purify.

11/5/99 : Officially deprecated the -htcl, -htk, and -plugin options
          from the Tcl and Tcl8 modules.

10/26/99: Removed unused variable from python/typemaps.i.  Patch
          contributed by Keith Davidson.

8/16/99 : Added _WIN32 symbol to libraries to better support Windows.

8/16/99 : Deprecated the Perl4 module.   It is no longer included in the
          distribution and no longer supported.  In the entire 3 years SWIG
          has been around I never received a single comment about it so I'm
          assuming no one will miss it...

8/16/99 : Modified the type-checking code to register type mappings using a
          table instead of repeated calls to SWIG_RegisterMapping().  This
          reduces the size of the module initialization function somewhat.

8/15/99 : Cleaned up the pointer type-checking code in the Tcl module.

8/15/99 : Many changes to the libraries to support runtime libraries.

8/13/99 : Eliminated C++ compiler warning messages about extern "C" linkage.

8/13/99 : Some cleanup of Python .swg files to better support runtime libraries
          on Windows.

8/13/99 : Modified the %pragma directive to attach pragmas declared inside
          a class definition to the class itself. For example:

               class foo {
                    ...
                    %pragma(python) addtomethod = "insert:print `hello world'"
                    ...
               }

          Most people don't need to worry about how this works.  For people
          writing backend modules, class-based pragmas work like this:

              lang->cpp_open_class()             // Open a class
              lang->cpp_pragma()                 // Supply pragmas
              ...                                // Emit members

              lang->cpp_close_class()            // Close the class

          All of the pragmas are passed first since they might be used to
          affect the code generation of other members.   Please see
          the Python module for an example.   Patches contributed
          by Robin Dunn.

8/13/99 : Patch to Python shadow classes to eliminate ignored
          exception errors in destructors.  Patch contributed
          by Robin Dunn.

8/11/99 : Minor patch to swig_lib/python/swigptr.swg  (added SWIGSTATIC
          declaration).  Patch contributed by Lyle Johnson.

8/11/99 : Added FIRSTKEY/NEXTKEY methods to Perl5 shadow classes
          Patch contributed by Dennis Marsa.

8/11/99 : Modified Python module so that NULL pointers are returned
          and passed as 'None.'  Patch contributed by Tal Shalif.

8/10/99 : Fixed missing 'int' specifiers in various places.

8/10/99 : Added Windows makefile for Runtime libraries.  Contributed
          by Bob Techentin.

8/10/99 : Fixed minor problem in Python runtime makefile introduced
          by keyword arguments.

8/8/99  : Changed $target of perl5(out) typemap from ST(0) to
          ST(argvi).  Patch contributed by Geoffrey Hort.

8/8/99  : Fixed bug in typemap checking related to the ANY keyword
          in arrays and ignored arguments.  Error reported by
          Geoffrey Hort.

8/8/99  : %enabledoc and %disabledoc directives can now be used
          inside class/structure definitions.   However, no check
          is made to see if they are balanced (i.e., a %disabledoc
          directive inside a class does not have to have a matching
          %enabledoc in the same class).

8/8/99  : Keyword argument handling is now supported in the Python
          module.   For example:

               int foo(char *bar, int spam, double x);

          Can be called from Python as

               foo(x = 3.4, bar="hello", spam=42)

          To enable this feature, run SWIG with the '-keyword' command
          line option.    Mixing keyword and default arguments
          should work as well.   Unnamed arguments are assigned names
          such as "arg1", "arg2", etc...

          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
          Functions with duplicate argument names such as
          bar(int *OUTPUT, int *OUTPUT) will likely cause problematic
          wrapper code to be generated.   To fix this,  use different
          names or use %apply to map typemaps to alternate names.

8/8/99  : Handling of the 'this' pointer has been changed in Python shadow
          classes.  Previously, dereferencing of '.this' occurred in the
          Python shadow class itself.   Now, this step occurs in the C
          wrappers using the following function:

                SWIG_GetPtrObj(PyObject *, void **ptr, char *type)

          This function can accept either a string containing a pointer
          or a shadow class instance with a '.this' attribute of
          appropriate type.  This change allows the following:

          1.  The real shadow class instance for an object is
              passed to the C wrappers where it can be examined/modified
              by typemaps.

          2.  Handling of default/keyword arguments is now greatly
              simplified.

          3.  The Python wrapper code is much more simple.

          Plus, it eliminated more than 300 lines of C++ code in the
          Python module.

          *** CAVEAT : This requires the abstract object interface.
          It should work with Python 1.4, but probably nothing older
          than that.


8/8/99  : Fixed handling of "const" and pointers in classes.  In particular,
          declarations such as

           class foo {
             ...
             const char *msg;
             const int  *iptr;
          }

          are handled as assignable variables as opposed to constant
          values (this is the correct behavior in C/C++).   Note:
          declarations such as "char *const msg" are still unsupported.
          Constants declared at the global level using const are also
          broken (because I have a number of interfaces that rely upon
          this behavior).

          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***  This may break interfaces that
          mistakenly treat 'const char *' types as constant values.

8/8/99  : Modified the parser to support bit-fields.    For example:

          typedef struct {
              unsigned int is_keyword : 1;
              unsigned int is_extern  : 1;
              unsigned int is_static  : 1;
          } flags;

          Bit-fields can only be applied to integer types and their
          are other restrictions.  SWIG performs no such type-checking
          (although the C compiler will catch problems when it tries to
          compile the wrapper code).

8/8/99  : Removed trailing space of $basetype substitution in typemaps.
          This is to allow things like this:

          %typemap(python, argout) spam** OUTPUT{
              ...
              char* a = "$basetype_p";
              ...
          }

          (Patch suggested by Nathan Dunfield).

6/22/99 : Made a very slight tweak to the Perl5 shadow class
          code that allows typemaps to alter the return type
          of objects (to support polymorphic types).  Patch
          contributed by Drake Diedrich.

4/8/99  : Fixed null pointer handling bug in Perl module.
          Patch contributed by Junio Hamano.

3/17/99 : Fixed bug in perl5ptr.swg for ActiveState Perl.
          Patch contributed by Greg Anderson.

2/27/99 : Eliminated segmentation fault when Swig runs on
          empty files.

2/27/99 : Added patch to Guile module to eliminate unused
          variables.   Contributed by Mike Simons.

2/27/99 : Fixed problem with %addmethods returning references.

2/27/99 : Fixed Runtime/Makefile. Patch contributed by
          Mike Romberg.

2/27/99 : Incorporated patches to the type-checker.

2/27/99 : Fixed problem with -exportall switch and shadow classes
          in Perl5 module.  Patch contributed by Dennis Marsa.

2/27/99 : Modified Perl5 module to recognize 'undef' as a NULL char *.
          Patch contributed by Junio Hamano.

2/27/99 : Fixed the Perl5 module to support the newer versions of
          ActiveState Perl for Win32.

2/27/99 : Fixed the include order of files specified with the
          -I option.

2/5/98- : Dave finishes his dissertation, goes job hunting, moves to
2/5/99    Chicago and generally thrashes about.

Version 1.1 Patch 5 (February 5, 1998)
======================================

2/4/98  : Fixed a bug in the configure script when different package
          locations are specified (--with-tclincl, etc...).

2/2/98  : Fixed name-clash bug related to the switch to C macros for accessor
          functions.  The new scheme did not work correctly for objects
          with members such as 'obj', 'val', etc...   Fixed the bug by
          appending the word 'swig' to macro argument names.  Patch
          contributed by Rudy Albachten.

2/2/98  : Slight fix to the Perl5 module to eliminate warning messages
          about 'varname used only once : possible typo'.  Fix
          contributed by Rudy Albachten.

1/9/98  : Fixed a bug in the Perl 5 module related to the creation of
          constants and shadow classes.

1/9/98  : Fixed linking bug with Python 1.5 embed.i library file.

Version 1.1 Patch 4 (January 4, 1998)
=====================================

1/4/98  : Changed structured of the Examples directory to be more friendly
          to Borland C++.

1/4/98  : Added the function Makefile.win.bc for compiling the examples
          under Borland 5.2.

1/4/98  : Slight change to the perl5 module and C++ compilation.  The
          <math.h> library is now included before any Perl headers
          because Perl the extern "C" linkage of math.h screws alot
          of things up (especially on Windows).

1/2/98  : Change to the Python module that reduces the number of constants
          created by C++ classes, inheritance, and shadow classes.   This
          modification may introduce a few slight incompatibilities if
          you attempt to use the non-shadow class interface with shadow
          classes enabled.    Patch contributed by Mike Romberg.

1/2/98  : Support for Tcl 8.0 namespaces has been added.   This *replaces*
          the original SWIG mechanism that assumed [incr Tcl] namespaces.
          To use namespaces, simply run SWIG with the following options

             swig -tcl -namespace  foo.i

                    This places everything in a namespace that matches
                    the module name

             swig -tcl -namespace -prefix bar foo.i

                    This places everything in the namespace 'bar'

          The use of namespaces is new in Tcl 8.0.  However, the wrapper code
          generated by SWIG will still work with all versions of Tcl newer
          than and including Tcl 7.3/Tk3.6 even if the -namespace option is
          used.

          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
          This change may break existing applications that relied on the
          -prefix and -namespace options.

1/2/98  : Added the following constants to the Tcl wrapper code

                 SWIG_name      - Name of the SWIG module
                 SWIG_prefix    - Prefix/namespace appended to command names
                 SWIG_namespace - Name of the namespace

          SWIG library writers can use these to their advantages.

1/2/98  : Fixed a bug in the Tcl8 module related to the creation of
          pointer constants (the function SWIG_MakePtr was missing from
          the wrapper code).

1/2/98  : Added the consthash.i library file to the Tcl and Tcl8 modules.

1/1/98  : Changed and cleaned up the Python typemaps.i file.   The following
          significant changes were made :

                1.  The OUTPUT typemap now returns Python tuples instead of
                    lists.   Lists can be returned as before by using the
                    L_OUTPUT type.    If compatibility with older versions
                    is needed, run SWIG with the -DOUTPUT_LIST option.

                2.  The BOTH typemap has been renamed to INOUT.  For backwards
                    compatibility, the "BOTH" method still exists however.

                3.  Output typemaps now generate less code than before.

          Changes to typemaps.i may break existing Python scripts that assume
          output in the form of a list.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

12/31/97: Fixed long overdue problems with the testing scripts and certain
          makefiles that required the use of the bash shell.   Everything should
          work properly with the standard Bourne shell (sh) now.

12/31/97: Modified typemaps to allow $basetype as a valid local variable.
          This allows for all sorts of bizarre hackish typemaps that
          do cool things.   Patch contributed by Dominique Dumont.

12/31/97: Switched accessor functions generated for member data to
          C preprocessor macros (except in cases involving typemaps
          or char *).

12/31/97: Fixed a bug related to C++ member data involving references.

12/31/97: Changed accessor functions for C++ member functions to
          preprocessor macros.   This cleans up the wrapper code
          and results in fewer function definitions.

12/31/97: Changed the default C constructor to use calloc() instead
          of malloc()

12/30/97: Changed the creation of constants in the Perl5 module.
          For all practical purposes, they should work in exactly the
          same way as before except that they now require much less
          wrapper code.   Modules containing large numbers of
          constants may see greater than a 50% reduction in wrapper
          code size.

12/30/97: Modified the Python module to be more intelligent about the
          creation of constants.  SWIG no longer generates redundant
          global variables and the size of the module initialization
          function should be reduced.   (Many thanks to Jim Fulton).

12/29/97: Fixed a bug in C++ code generation related to member functions,
          default arguments, and references.

12/29/97: Fixed configure script and a few makefiles to support Python 1.5

12/29/97: Added 'embed15.i' library file.  This file should be used to
          statically link versions of Python 1.5.    To make it the default,
          simply copy 'swig_lib/python/embed15.i' to 'swig_lib/python/embed.i'

Version 1.1 Patch 3 (November 24, 1997)
========================================

11/23/97: Fixed a bug in the Perl5 module with shadow classes and
          static class functions that return class instances.
          Note : The fix for this bug requires a slight restructuring of
          of the .pm files created by SWIG.

11/23/97: Fixed a bug in the Tcl/Tcl8 modules related to variable linking
          of character arrays.  If you declared a global variable 'char foo[10]',
          the generated wrapper code would either cause a segmentation fault
          immediately upon loading or weird memory corruption elsewhere.
          This should now be fixed although character arrays can only be
          read-only.

11/23/97: Fixed a bug with the %import directive that caused it to
          fail if files were imported from directories other than
          the current working directory.

11/23/97: Fixed incorrect diagnostic message in the ASCII documentation
          module.

11/23/97: Changed the behavior of the -o option when used with shadow
          classes. If -o was used to specify both the pathname and filename
          of SWIG's output such as

                 swig -o /home/swig/wrapper.c -shadow -perl5 foo.i

          The wrapper code would be placed the file specified with -o,
          but the .pm file and documentation would be placed in the
          directory where SWIG was run.   Now, these files are placed
          in the same directory as the file specified with the -o option.
          This change is also needed for proper operation on the
          Macintosh.

11/23/97: Added a 'this()' method to Perl5 shadow classes.   This can
          be used to return the normal pointer value from a shadow
          class that is represented as a tied hash.   To use just
          invoke as a method like this :

              $l = new List;       # Create an object
              $ptr = $l->this();   # Get the normal pointer value

          *** NEW FEATURE ***

11/23/97: Fixed the Tcl 8 pointer.i library file (which was completely
          broken in 1.1p2).

11/23/97: Modified the Perl5 type-checker to fix a few problems
          with global variables of pointer types and to allow
          tied hashes to be used interchangably with normal
          pointer values.

11/23/97: Modified the typemap mechanism to allow output
          typemaps of type 'void'.   These were ignored previously,
          but now if you specify,

                %typemap(lang,out) void {
                      ... return a void ...
                }

          You can change or assign a return value to the function.

11/23/97: Fixed processing of 'bool' datatypes in the Python module.

11/23/97: Fixed minor parsing error with C++ initializers. For example,

                 class B : public A {
                 public:
                       B() : A() { ... };
                       ...
                 }

11/23/97: Fixed the Tcl8 module so that C functions that call back into
          Tcl don't corrupt the return result object (SWIG was gathering
          the result object too early which leads to problems if subsequent
          Tcl calls are made).

11/23/97: Fixed a code generation bug in the Python module when two or
          more output parameters were used as the first arguments of a
          function.  For example :

                 %include typemaps.i
                 void foo(double *OUTPUT, double *OUTPUT, double a);

          Previously, doing this resulted in the creation of an
          extraneous comma in the output, resulting in a C syntax error.

11/22/97: Fixed a bug when template handling that was stripping whitespace
          around nested templates.   For example :

                 Foo<Bar<double> >

          was getting munged into Foo<Bar>> which is a syntax error in
          in the C++ compiler.

11/22/97: Fixed bugs in the Borland C++ makefiles.

11/22/97: Fixed memory corruption bug when processing integer
          arguments in Tcl8 module.

11/21/97: Fixed a bug in the Runtime/Makefile related to Tcl 8.

11/21/97: Fixed a bug with the %new directive and Perl5 shadow classes.
          No longer generates a perl syntax error.

11/9/97 : Changed a strncpy() to strcpy() in the pointer type-checker.
          This results in a substantial performance improvement in
          type-checking.

10/29/97: Fixed a bug in the code generation of default arguments and
          user-defined types.  For example :

                 void foo(Vector a, Vector b = d);

          should now work properly.

Version 1.1 Patch 2 (September 4, 1997)
=======================================

9/4/97  : Fixed problem with handling of virtual functions that
          was introduced by some changes in the C++ module.

Version 1.1 Patch 1 (August 27, 1997)
=====================================

8/26/97 : Fixed compilation and run-time bugs with Tcl 8.0 final.

8/21/97 : Fixed code generation bug with arrays appearing as arguments
          to C++ member functions.  For example :

                class Foo {
                public:
                      void Bar(int a[20][20]);
                };

          There is still a bug using arrays with added methods
          however.

8/20/97 : Fixed a bug with generating the code for added methods
          involving pass-by-value.

8/19/97 : Modified the typemapper to substitute the '$arg' value
          when declaring local variables.    For example :

              %typemap(in) double * (double temp_$arg) {
                    ... do something ...
              }

          When applied to a real function such as the following :

              void foo(double *a, double *b, double *result);

          three local variables will be created as follows :

              double temp_a;
              double temp_b;
              double temp_result;

          This can be used when writing multiple typemaps that need
          to access the same local variables.


7/27/97 : Fixed a variety of problems with the %apply directive and arrays.
          The following types of declarations should now work :

               %apply double [ANY] { Real [ANY] };
               %apply double [4] { double [10] };

          A generic version of apply like this :

               %apply double { Real };

          should now work--even if arrays involving doubles and Reals are
          used later.

7/27/97 : Changed warning message about "Array X has been converted to Y" to
          only appear if running SWIG in verbose mode.

7/27/97 : Added the variables $parmname and $basemangle to the typemap
          generator.    $parmname is the name of the parameter used
          when the typemap was matched.  It may be "" if no parameter
          was used.   $basemangle is a mangled version of the base
          datatype.    Sometimes used for array handling.

7/27/97 : Changed the behavior of output arguments with Python shadow classes.
          Originally, if a function returned an object 'Foo', the shadow class
          mechanism would create code like this :

                def return_foo():
                      val = FooPtr(shadowc.return_foo())
                      val.this = 1
                      return val

          The problem with this is that typemaps allow a user to redefine
          the output behavior of a function--as a result, we can no longer
          make any assumptions about the return type being a pointer or
          even being a single value for that matter (it could be a list,
          tuple, etc...).   If SWIG detects the use of output typemaps
          (either "out" or "argout") it returns the result unmodified like
          this :

                def return_foo():
                      val = shadowc.return_foo()
                      return val

          In this case, it is up to the user to figure out what to do
          with the return value (including the possibility of converting it
          into a Python class).

7/26/97 : Fixed a parsing problem with types like 'unsigned long int',
          'unsigned short int', etc...

7/24/97 : Minor bug fix to Tcl 8 module to parse enums properly.  Also
          fixed a memory corruption problem in the type-checker.
          (patch contributed by Henry Rowley.

7/24/97 : Added Python-tuple typemaps contributed by Robin Dunn.

7/24/97 : Incorporated some changes to the Python module in support of
          Mark Hammond's COM support.  I'm not entirely sure they
          work yet however.  Needs documentation and testing.

7/24/97 : Fixed code generation bugs when structures had array members
          and typemaps were used.  For example :

              %typemap(memberin) double [20][20] {
                      ... get a double [20][20] ...
              }
              struct Foo {
                     double a[20][20];
              }

          Originally, this would generate a compiler-type error when
          the wrapper code was compiled.   Now, a helper function like
          this is generated :

                double *Foo_a_set(Foo *a, double val[20][20]) {
                         ... memberin typemap here ...
                         return (double *) val;
                }

          When writing typemaps, one can assume that the source variable
          is an array of the *same* type as the structure member. This
          may break some codes that managed to work around the array bug.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

7/13/97 : Fixed bug in Perl5 module when using C global variables that
          are pointers.  When used in function calls and other operations,
          the value of the pointer would be invalid---causing core
          dumps and other problems.  SWIG implements global variables
          using Perl magic variables.  As it turns out, the error
          was caused by the fact that the pointer-extraction code
          was somehow bypassing the procedure used to resolve magical
          variables (hence, leaving the value undefined).  To fix
          the problem, SWIG now explicitly resolves magic before
          extracting pointer values.

7/12/97 : Eliminated the last remnants of free() and malloc() from
          the SWIG compiler.

7/12/97 : Fixed parsing problems with typemaps involving arrays and
          temporary variables of arrays.    Also made it possible for
          SWIG to handle typemaps like this :

                 %typemap(in) double [ANY] (double temp[$dim0]) {
		      ... store data in temp[$dim0] ...
                 }

          Not only does this typemap match any double [] array, it
          creates a local variable with precisely the right dimensions.
          (ie. $dim0 gets filled in with the real number of dimensions).
          Of course, off the record, this will be a way to add more
          functionality to the typemaps.i libraries.

7/9/97  : Fixed some problems with Perl5, static linking, and shadow
          classes.  When statically linking multiple modules together, write
          a top-level interface file like this when shadow classes are not
          used :

                 %module swig, foo, bar, glob;
                 %include perlmain.i

          When shadow classes are used, the module names have an extra 'c'
          appended so it should read as :

                 %module swig, fooc, barc, globc;
                 %include perlmain.i

          When linking multiple modules, consider using the SWIG runtime
          library.

7/8/97  : Incorporated fixed versions of the Borland C++ Makefiles.

7/8/97  : First cut at trying to eliminate excessive compiler warnings.
          As it turns out, alot of warnings go away if you just make
          declarations like this

                  clientData = clientData;

          in the resulting wrapper code.  Most compilers should just
          ignore this code (at least would can hope).

7/8/97  : Fixed bizarre code generation bug with typemaps and C++ classes.
          In some cases, typemaps containing printf formatting strings such as

                  %typemap(memberout) int * {
                         printf("%d",42);
                  }

          Would generate completely bogus code with garbage replacing
          the '%d'.   Caused by one faulty use of printf (wasn't able to find
          any other occurrences).

7/7/97  : Fixed bug in Python shadow class generation with non-member
          functions that are returning more than one value.

7/7/97  : Incorporated modifications to make SWIG work with Guile 1.2.
          Still need to test it out, but it is rumored to work.

7/2/97  : Fixed some bugs related to output arguments and Python shadow
          classes.    If an output argument is detected, SWIG assumes
          that the result is a list and handles it appropriately.
          If the normal return type of an function is an object,
          it will be converted into a shadow class as before, but
          with the assumption that it is the first element of a
          list.  *** NOTE : This behavior has been subsequently changed ***

6/29/97 : Changed EXPORT to SWIGEXPORT in all of the language modules.
          Should provide better compatibility with Windows.

6/29/97 : Modified Python shadow classes so that output arguments
          work correctly (when typemaps are used).

Version 1.1 (June 24, 1997)
===========================

6/24/97 : Fixed Objective-C constructor bug when working with Perl5
          shadow classes.

6/23/97 : Fixed some parsing problems with Objective-C.  Declarations
          such as the following should work now :

               - foo : (int) a with: (int) b;

6/22/97 : Added SWIG Runtime library.   This library contains
          the SWIG pointer type-checker and support functions
          that are normally included in every module.  By using
          the library, it is easier to work with multiple SWIG
          generated modules.

6/22/97 : Fixed minor bug in Perl5 module related to static linking
          of multiple modules.

6/22/97 : Fixed some bugs with the %import directive. When used with
          Perl5 shadow classes, this generates a 'require' statement
          to load in external modules.

6/22/97 : Added -swiglib option.  This prints out the location of the
          SWIG library and exits.  This option is only really useful to
          configuration tools that are looking for SWIG and its library
          location (e.g. autoconf, configure, etc...).

6/21/97 : Fixed export bug with Perl5.004 on Windows-NT.

6/20/97 : Minor change to code generation of class/structure members in
          order to work better with typemaps. Should have no noticable
          impact on existing SWIG modules.

6/19/97 : Added -t option. This allows SWIG to load a typemap file before
          processing any declarations.  For example :

                 swig -t typemaps.i -python example.i

          At most, only one typemap file can be specified in this manner.
          *** NEW FEATURE ***

6/18/97 : Need a Makefile fast? Type

                 swig [-tcl, -perl5, -python] -co Makefile

          and you will get a Makefile specific to that target language.
          You just need to modify it for your application and you're
          ready to run.

6/18/97 : Completed the -ci option.  This option checks a file into the
          SWIG library.   It should be used in conjunction with a
          language option. For example :

                  swig -tcl -ci foobar.i

          Checks the file foobar.i into the Tcl part of the library.
          In order to check a file into the general library (accessible
          to all languages modules), do the following

                  swig -ci -o ../foobar.i foobar.i

          (Admittedly this looks a little strange but is unavoidable).
          The check-in option is primarily designed for SWIG maintenance
          and library development. The command will fail if the user does
          not have write permission to the SWIG library.  Third party library
          extensions can easily install themselves by simply providing
          a shell script that uses 'swig -ci' to install the appropriate
          library files.  It is not necessary to know where the SWIG library
          is located if you use this mechanism.
          *** NEW FEATURE ***

6/16/97 : Fixed a bug in shadow class generation when %name() was applied
          to a class definition.   Unfortunately, fixing the bug required
          a change in the Language C API by adding an extra argument to
          the Language::cpp_class_decl() function.  This may break
          SWIG C++ extensions.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

6/15/97 : Added a warning message if no module name is specified with the
          %module directive or -module option.

6/15/97 : Fixed line number bug when reporting errors for undefined
          base classes.

6/15/97 : Added new %rename directive.  This allows the forward declaration
          of a renaming.  For example :

                 %rename OldName NewName;

                 .... later ...
                 int OldName(int);

          Unlike %name, %rename will rename any occurrence of the old name.
          This applies to functions, variables, class members and so forth.
          There is no way to disable %rename once set, but you can change the
          name by redeclaring it to something else.
          *** NEW FEATURE ***

6/15/97 : Improved the implementation of the %name directive so that it
          could be used with conditional compilation :

                    #ifdef SWIG
                    %name(NewName)
                    #endif
                    int OldName(int);

6/15/97 : Added support for functions with no return datatype.  In this case,
          SWIG assumes a return type of 'int'.

6/11/97 : Improved error reporting in the parser.  It should be a little
          less sensitive to errors that occur inside class definitions
          now.  Also reports errors for function pointers.

6/11/97 : Made '$' a legal symbol in identifiers.  This is to support
          some Objective-C libraries.  Some compilers (such as gcc) may also
          allow identifiers to contain a $ in C/C++ code as well (this is
          an obscure feature of C). When '$' appears in identifier, SWIG
          remaps it to the string '_S_' when creating the scripting language
          function. Thus a function 'foo$bar' would be called 'foo_S_bar'.

6/11/97 : Fixed bug in Python shadow classes with __repr__ method.  If
          supplied by the user, it was ignored, but now it should work.

6/9/97  : Fixed the Tcl 8.0 module to work with Tcl 8.0b1.   SWIG is no
          longer compatible with *any* alpha release of Tcl 8.0.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

6/7/97  : Put a maximal error count in (currently set to 20). SWIG will bail out
          if it generates more errors than this (useful for preventing SWIG
          from printing 4000 syntax errors when it gets confused).

6/7/97  : Fixed segmentation fault when parsing variable length arguments.

6/7/97  : Minor change to Perl5 module.  C++ static functions are now
          put in the same package as their class when using shadow classes.

6/7/97  : Centralized the naming of functions, members, wrappers etc... By
          centralizing the naming scheme, it should be possible to make
          some multi-file optimizations.  Also, it should be possible to
          change SWIG's naming scheme (perhaps a new feature to be added
          later).

6/2/97  : Added 'arginit' typemap.   This can be used to assign initial values
          to function arguments.  Doing so makes it somewhat easier to detect
          improper argument passing when working with other typemaps.

6/2/97  : Fixed code generation bug when read-only variables were inherited
          into other classes.  Under inheritance, the variables would
          become writable, but this has now been corrected.

5/30/97 : An empty %name() directive is no longer allowed or supported.
          This directive was originally used to strip the prefix
          off of a class or structure.  Unfortunately, this never really
          seemed to work right and it complicated the C++ code generator
          significantly.   As far as I can tell no one uses it, so it
          is now history.  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

5/28/97 : Fixed a parsing bug with #define and C++ comments.  Declarations
          such as the following now work properly :

                   #define CONST   4     // A Comment

5/28/97 : Made some performance improvements to the SWIG String class.
          (only affects the SWIG compiler itself).

5/28/97 : Modified the parser to skip template definitions and issue a
          warning message.

5/28/97 : Preliminary support for parameterized types added (ie. templates).
          Types such as the following should pass through the SWIG compiler

                    void foo(vector<complex> *a, vector<double> *b);

          When used, the entire name 'vector<complex>' becomes the name
          of the datatype.      Due to space limitations in datatype
          representations, the name should not exceed 96 characters.

          Note : This is only part of what is needed for template support.
          Template class definitions are not yet supported by SWIG.

          The template notation above may also be used when specifying
          Objective-C protocol lists.
          *** NEW FEATURE ***

5/24/97 : First cut at Objective-C support added.   As it turns out, almost
          everything can be handled with only a few minor modifications to
          the C++ module.
          *** NEW FEATURE ***

5/23/97 : Fixed repeated definition bug in multiple inheritance handling
          when multiple base classes share a common base class (ie.
          the evil diamond).

5/21/97 : Fixed rather embarrassing typo that worked its way into the
          Tests/Build directory.

5/19/97 : Fixed code generation bug when using native methods and
          shadow classes with Python and Perl5 modules.

5/19/97 : Modified the %apply directive slightly so that it would work
          with pointers a little better. For example :

                  %apply unsigned long { DWORD };

          Applies *all* typemaps associated with "unsigned long" to
          "DWORD".   This now includes pointers to the two datatypes.
          For example, a typemap applied to "unsigned long **" would
          also be applied to any occurrence of "DWORD **" as well.

5/19/97 : Fixed an ownership assignment bug in the Perl5 module when
          class members were returning new objects belonging to
          different classes.

5/17/97 : Added a few more typemap variables.

                  $name          - Name of function/variable/member
                  $basetype      - Base datatype (type without pointers)
                  $argnum        - Argument number

5/16/97 : Fixed embarrassing underscore error in local variable
          allocator.

5/16/97 : Fixed namespace clash bug in parameterized typemaps
          when creating arrays as new local variables.

5/15/97 : Fixed some bugs with inheritance of added methods across
          multiple files.   SWIG now uses names of base classes
          when generating such functions.

5/14/97 : Finished support for default typemaps.  Primarily used
          internally, they can be used to match the basic
          built-in datatypes used inside of SWIG.   You can
          specify them in interface files as well like this :

               %typemap(tcl,in) int SWIG_DEFAULT_TYPE {
                        $target = atoi($target);
               }

          Unlike normal typemaps, this default map will get applied
          to *all* integer datatypes encountered, including those
          renamed with typedef, etc...

5/13/97 : Fixed substring bug in type checker.

5/12/97 : Fixed bug in parameterized typemaps when declaring local
          variables of structures.

Version 1.1 Beta6 (May 9, 1997)
===============================

5/9/97  : Fixed bizarre NULL pointer handling bug in Perl5 module.

5/8/97  : Fixed mysterious segmentation fault when running SWIG on an
          empty file.

5/7/97  : The code generator will now replace the special symbol "$cleanup"
          with the cleanup code specified with the "freearg" typemap.
          This change needed to properly manage memory and exceptions.

5/5/97  : Added the 'typemaps.i' library file.  This contains a
          variety of common typemaps for input values, pointers,
          and so on.

5/5/97  : Changed behavior of "argout" typemap in Python module.
          Old versions automatically turned the result into a
          Python list.  The new version does nothing, leaving the
          implementation up to the user.  This provides more flexibility
          but may break older codes that rely on typemaps.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

5/5/97  : Fixed bug in Python module related to the interaction of
          "argout" and "ignore" typemaps.

5/5/97  : Fixed bug in Python module that would generate incorrect code
          if all function arguments are "ignored".

5/4/97  : Added %apply and %clear directives.   These form a higher level
          interface to the typemap mechanism.  In a nutshell, they
          can be used to change the processing of various datatypes without
          ever having to write a typemap.  See the SWIG documentation
          for more details.  ** NEW FEATURE **

5/4/97  : Added a local variable extension to the typemap handler.
          For example :

                 %typemap(tcl,in) double *(double temp) {
		        temp = atof($source);
                        $target = &temp;
                 }

          In this case, 'temp' is a local variable that exists
          in the entire wrapper function (not just the typemap
          code).  This mechanism provides better support for
          certain types of argument handling and also makes it
          possible to write thread-safe typemaps.  Any number
          local variables can be declared by supplying a comma
          separated list.   Local variables are guaranteed to be
          unique, even if the same typemap is applied many times
          in a given function.
          ** Not currently supported in Perl4 or Guile modules.

5/2/97  : Fixed processing of %ifdef, %endif, %if, etc...  (These are
          SWIG equivalents of the C preprocessor directives that
          can pass through the C preprocessor without modification).

5/2/97  : Fixed major (but subtle) bug in the run-time type checker
          related to searching and type-checking for C++ inheritance.
          To make a long story short, if you had two classes named
          "Foo" and "FooObject" the type checker would sometimes
          get confused and be unable to locate "Foo" in an internal
          table.

5/2/97  : Fixed some bugs in the -co option.

4/24/97 : Pointer library added to the SWIG library.

4/19/97 : Added the %new directive.   This is a "hint" that can be used
          to tell SWIG that a function is returning a new object. For
          example :

                  %new Foo *create_foo();

          This tells SWIG that create_foo() is creating a new object
          and returning a pointer to it.   Many language modules may
          choose to ignore the hint, but when working with shadow classes,
          the %new is used to handle proper ownership of objects.

          %new can also be used with dynamically allocated strings.
          For example :

                  %new char *create_string();

          When used, all of the language modules will automatically cleanup
          the returned string--eliminating memory leaks.
          ** NEW FEATURE **

4/19/97 : Added a new typemap "newfree".   This is used in conjunction with
          the %new directive and can be used to change the method by which
          a new object returned by a function is deleted.

4/19/97 : The symbol "__cplusplus" is now defined in the SWIG interpreter
          when running with the -c++ option.

4/17/97 : Added support for static member functions when used inside the
          %addmethods directive.

4/15/97 : Added a special typemap symbol PREVIOUS that can be used to
          restore a previous typemap. For example :

	         %typemap(tcl,in) int * = PREVIOUS;

          This is primarily used in library files.

4/13/97 : Added %pragma directive for Perl5 module.   Two new pragmas are
          available :

                 %pragma(perl5) code = "string"
                 %pragma(perl5) include = "file.pl"

          Both insert code into the .pm file created by SWIG.  This can
          be used to automatically customize the .pm file created by SWIG.

4/13/97 : Scanner modified to only recognize C++ keywords when the -c++
          option has been specified.  This provides support for C programs
          that make use of these keywords for identifiers.
          SWIG may need to be explicitly run with the -c++ option when
          compiling C++ code (this was allowed, but not recommended in
          previous versions). **POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY**

4/11/97 : Fixed a rather nasty bug in the Perl5 module related to using
          variable linking with complex datatypes and pointers.   On Unix,
          code would work (somehow), but would cause an access violation
          under Windows-NT.  The fix should correct the problem,
          but there may still be a problem using global variables of
          complex datatypes in conjunction with shadow classes.  Fortunately,
          this sort of thing seems to be relatively rare (considering
          that the bug has been around for more than a year - yikes!).

4/11/97 : Fixed bizarre constant evaluation bug in Perl5 code generation
          when running under Windows-NT.

4/8/97  : Bug when using default arguments and C++ references fixed.

4/8/97  : Fixed code generation bugs in Python and Perl5 modules related to
          using class renaming (applying the %name directive to a class
          definition) and shadow classes.

4/7/97  : Fixed minor bugs in swigptr.swg, tcl8ptr.swg, and perl5ptr.swg to
          prevent infinite loops when weird datatypes are passed.

3/29/97 : 'Makefile.win' added.   This is used to build most of the examples
          in the Examples directory under Windows NT/95.

3/27/97 : Fixes to SWIG's error return codes.   SWIG now returns non-zero
          exit codes for certain kinds of errors (which makes it more
          friendly to makefiles).     An overhaul of the error handling
          is on the to-do list and will probably show up in a later release.

3/25/97 : Bug fix.  "freearg" and "argout" typemaps have been fixed in
          the Perl5 module.  In previous versions, function input parameters
          and function output parameters shared the same memory space--causing
          all sorts of nasty problems when trying to pass perl values by
          reference.   SWIG now internally makes a "copy" (which is really
          just a pointer) of affected parameters and uses that.   This
          is done transparently so there is no noticable impact on any
          SWIG generated modules.   This change is probably only noticable
          to expert users.

3/25/97 : Added type-check to verbose and stat mode.  SWIG will now generate a list
          of all datatypes that were used but undefined (useful for tracking
          down weird bugs).   This is enabled with the -v option (which
          is now officially known as "overly verbose" mode) or the -stat option.

3/25/97 : Slight change to the parser to make include guards work correctly.
          For example :

                #ifndef INTERFACE_I
                #define INTERFACE_I
                %module foobar.i
                ... declarations ...
                #endif

3/24/97 : %checkout directive added.   This allows an interface file to
          extract files from the SWIG library and place them in the
          current directory.   This can be used to extract scripts and
          other helper code that might be associated with library files.
          For example :

                %checkout array.tcl

          Will look for a file "array.tcl" in the library and copy it
          to the current directory.    If the file already exists in the
          directory, this directive does nothing (it will not overwrite an
          existing file).  This only an experimental feature for now.

3/24/97 : SWIG will now look in the SWIG Library for a file if it can't
          find it in the current directory.  As a result, it is easy to
          make modules from SWIG library files.  For example, if you
          want to make a Python module from the SWIG timers library, just
          type this in any directory :

                swig -python timers.i

          You will get the files timers_wrap.c and timers_wrap.doc in
          the current directory that you can now compile.   The file
          remains in the SWIG library (although you can check it out
          using the -co option).  *** New Feature ***

3/24/97 : -co option added to SWIG to allow easy access to the SWIG library.
          When used, this instructs SWIG to check out a library file and
          place it in the current directory.  For example :

                unix > swig -co array.i
                array.i checked out from the SWIG library
                unix >

          Once in your directory you can customize the file to suit your
          particular purposes.  The checkout option makes it easy to
          grab library files without knowing anything about the SWIG
          installation, but it also makes it possible to start
          including scripts, C code, and other miscellaneous files
          in the library.  For example, you could put a cool script
          in the library and check it out whenever you wanted to use it.
          *** New Feature ***

3/24/97 : #pragma export directives added to Tcl output for compiling
          shared libraries on the Mac.

3/24/97 : Minor changes to wish.i and tclsh.i library files to provide
          support for the Macintosh.

3/19/97 : SWIG's policy towards NULL pointers has been relaxed.  The
          policy of requiring a special compiler directive -DALLOW_NULL
          to use NULL pointers is no longer supported.  While this may
          seem "unsafe", it turns out that you can use a "check"
          typemap to achieve some safety.   For example :

                %typemap(perl5,check) Node * {
                       if (!$target)
                            croak("NULL Pointers not allowed.");
                }

          This prevents any NULL value of a "Node *" pointer to be
          passed to a function.   (I think this is much cleaner
          than the old -DALLOW_NULL hack anyways).

3/19/97 : Fixed pointer handling errors in Perl5 module.  Modules no
          longer core dump when a Perl reference is inadvertently
          passed in as a C pointer.

3/18/97 : Added a "check" typemap.   This can be used to check the
          validity of function input values.  For example :

                %typemap(perl5,check) int posint {
                       if ($target < 0)
                           croak("Argument is not a positive integer");
                }

3/18/97 : Added an $arg variable to Tcl typemaps.   This makes it easier
          to return argument values by "reference".

3/18/97 : Fixed a code generation bug when using C++ references and
          the %addmethods directive.

3/18/97 : Fixed a few glitches in the typemap module with respect to
          chaining. For example :

                %typemap(tcl,in) int {
                       $in                // Inserts prexisting typemap
                       printf("Received a %d\n", $target);
                }

          This has been allowed for quite some time, but didn't work
          if no existing typemap was defined.  Now, it still doesn't
          work if no existing typemap is defined, but it issues a
          warning message.   There is some support using default typemaps,
          but none of the language modules take advantage of it.  This
          should be considered experimental at this time.

Version 1.1b5 Patch 1 (March 16, 1997)
======================================

3/16/97 : Fixed references bug with C++ code generation.

3/16/97 : Fixed initialization bug in the documentation system that
          was causing weird problems.

3/16/97 : Fixed fatal bug with -c option in the Python module.

3/13/97 : Fixed bug in the documentation system involving the %text directive
          and sorting. In the old system, %text entries would float to the
          top of a section because they were "nameless".   Now they are
          attached to the previous declaration and will stay in the proper
          location relative to the previous entry.

Version 1.1b5 (March 12, 1997)
==============================

3/11/97 : Fixed compilation problems introduced by Tcl/Tk 8.0a2.
          *** INCOMPATIBILITY *** SWIG no longer works with Tcl/Tk 8.0a1.

3/10/97 : Fixed bug with ignored arguments and C++ member functions in
          the Python module.

3/9/97  : Parsing bugs with nested class definitions and privately
          declared nested class definitions fixed.

3/9/97  : Fixed a few minor code generation bugs with C++ classes and
          constructors.   In some cases, the resulting wrapper code
          would not compile properly.   SWIG now attempts to use
          the default copy constructor instead.

3/8/97  : Added a -l option to SWIG that allows additional SWIG library files
          to be grabbed without having them specified in the interface file.
          This makes it easier to keep the interface file clean and move certain
          options into a Makefile.   For example :

              swig -tcl example.i              #  Build a normal Tcl extension
              swig -tcl -lwish.i example.i     #  Build it as a wish extension
                                               #  by including the 'wish.i' file.

              swig -python example.i           # Build a dynamically loaded extension
              swig -python -lembed.i example.i # Build a static extension

          These kinds of options could previously be accomplished with
          conditional compilation such as :

                   %module example
                   ...
                   #ifdef STATIC
                   %include embed.i
                   #endif

3/8/97  : Incorporated changes to Guile module to use the new gh interface
          in FSF Guile 1.0.    The older gscm interface used in Cygnus
          Guile releases is no longer supported by SWIG.

3/8/97  : Cleaned up the Tcl Netscape plugin example.   It should work with
          version 1.1 of the plugin now.

3/8/97  : Added better array support to the typemap module.  The keyword
          ANY can now be used to match any array dimension.  For example :

                    %typemap(tcl,in) double [ANY] {
                           ... get an array ...
                    }

          This will match any single-dimensional double array.   The array
          dimension is passed in the variables $dim0, $dim1, ... $dim9.  For
          example :

		    %typemap(tcl,in) double [ANY][ANY][ANY] {
			printf("Received a double[%d][%d][%d]\n",$dim0,$dim1,$dim2);
	            }

          Any typemap involving a specific array dimension will override any
          specified with the ANY tag.  Thus, a %typemap(tcl,in) double [5][4][ANY] {}
          would override a double [ANY][ANY][ANY].  However, overuse of the ANY
          tag in arrays of high-dimensions may not work as you expect due to
          the pattern matching rule used. For example, which of the following
          typemaps has precedence?

                      %typemap(in) double [ANY][5] {}     // Avoid this!
                      %typemap(in) double [5][ANY] {}

3/7/97  : Fixed a number of bugs related to multi-dimensional array handling.
          Typedefs involving multi-dimensional arrays now works correctly.
          For example :

                    typedef double MATRIX[4][4];

                    ...
                    extern double foo(MATRIX a);

          Typecasting of pointers into multi-dimensional arrays is now
          implemented properly when making C/C++ function calls.

3/6/97  : Fixed potentially dangerous bug in the Tcl Object-oriented
          interface.  Well, actually, didn't fix it but issued a
          Tcl error instead.   The bug would manifest itself as follows:

                 % set l [List]           # Create an object
                 ...
                 % set m [List -this $l]  # Make $m into an object assuming $l
                                          # contains a pointer.
                                          # Since $m == $l, $l gets destroyed
                                          # (since its the same command name)
                 % $m insert Foo
                 Segmentation fault       # Note : the list no longer exists!

          Now, an error will be generated instead of redefining the command.
          As in :

                 % set l [List]
                 ...
                 % set m [List -this $l]
                 Object name already exists!

          Use catch{} to ignore the error.

3/3/97  : Better support for enums added.   Datatypes of 'enum MyEnum'
          and typedefs such as 'typedef enum MyEnum Foo;' now work.

3/3/97  : Parser modified to ignore constructor initializers such as :

               class Foo : public Bar {
               int a,b;
               public:
                     Foo(int i) : a(0), b(i), Bar(i,0) { };
               };

3/3/97  : Modified parser to ignore C++ exception specifications such as :

               int foo(double) throw(X,Y);

3/3/97  : Added %import directive.  This works exactly like %extern
          except it tells the language module that the declarations are
          coming from a separate module.   This is usually only
          needed when working with shadow classes.

3/2/97  : Changed pointer type-checker to be significantly more
          efficient when working with derived datatypes.  This
          has been accomplished by storing type-mappings in sorted
          order, using binary search schemes, and caching recently
          used datatypes.   For SWIG generated C++ modules that
          make a large number of C function calls with derived types,
          this could result in speedups of between 100 and 50000 percent.
          However, due to the required sorting operation, module
          loading time may increased slightly when there are lots of
          datatypes.

3/2/97  : Fixed some C++ compilation problems with Python
          embed.i library files.

2/27/97 : Slight change to C++ code generation to use copy constructors
          when returning complex data type by value.

2/26/97 : Fixed bug in Python module with -c option.

2/26/97 : Slight tweak of parser to allow trailing comma in enumerations
          such as

                enum Value (ALE, STOUT, LAGER, };

2/25/97 : Fixed code generation bug in Tcl module when using the
          %name() directive on a classname.

2/25/97 : Finished code-size optimization of C++ code generation with
          inheritance of attributes.    Inherited attributes now
          only generate one set of wrapper functions that are re-used
          in any derived classes.   This could provide big code
          size improvements in some scripting language interfaces.

2/25/97 : Perl5 module modified to support both the Unix and Windows
          versions.  The windows version has been tested with the
          Activeware port of Perl 5.003 running under Windows 95.
          The C source generated by SWIG should compile without
          modification under both versions of Perl, but is now
          even more hideous than before.

2/25/97 : Modified parser to allow scope resolution operation to
          appear in expressions and default arguments as in :

                void foo(int a =  Bar::defvalue);

2/25/97 : Fixed bug when resolving symbols inside C++ classes.
          For example :

               class Foo {
               public:
                   enum Value {ALE, STOUT, LAGER};
                   ...
                   void defarg(Value v = STOUT);

              };

2/24/97 : Fixed bug with member functions returning void *.

2/23/97 : Modified Python module to be better behaved under Windows

            -  Module initialization function is now properly exported.
               It should not be necessary to explicitly export this function
               yourself.

            -  Bizarre compilation problems when compiling the SWIG wrapper
               code as ANSI C under Visual C++ 4.x fixed.

            -  Tested with both the stock Python-1.4 distribution and Pythonwin
               running under Win95.

2/19/97 : Fixed typedef handling bug in Perl5 shadow classes.

2/19/97 : Added exception support.  To use it, do the following :

              %except(lang) {
                  ... try part of the exception ...
                  $function
                  ... catch part of exception ...
              }

          $function is a SWIG variable that will be replaced by the
          actual C/C++ function call in a wrapper function.  Thus,
          a real exception specification might look like this :

             %except(perl5) {
                  try {
                  $function
                  } catch (char *& sz) {
                    ... process an exception ...
                  } catch(...) {
                    croak("Unknown exception. Bailing out...");
                  }
             }

2/19/97 : Added support for managing generic code fragments (needed
          for exceptions).

2/19/97 : Fixed some really obscure typemap scoping bugs in the C++
          handler.

2/18/97 : Cleaned up perlmain.i file by removing some problematic,
          but seemingly unnecessary declarations.

2/18/97 : Optimized handling of member functions under inheritance.
          SWIG can now use wrapper functions generated for a
          base class instead of regenerating wrappers for
          the same functions in a derived class.    This could
          make a drastic reduction in wrapper code size for C++
          applications with deep inheritance hierarchies and
          lots of functions.

2/18/97 : Additional methods specified with %addmethods can now
          be inherited along with normal C++ member functions.

2/18/97 : Minor internal fixes to make SWIG's string handling a little
          safer.

2/16/97 : Moved some code generation of Tcl shadow classes to
          library files.

2/16/97 : Fixed documentation error of '-configure' method in
          Tcl modules.

2/16/97 : Modified Perl5 module slightly to allow typemaps
          to use Perl references.

2/12/97 : Fixed argument checking bug that was introduced by
          default arguments (function calls with too many
          arguments would still be executed).  Functions now
          must have the same number of arguments as C version
          (with possibility of default/optional arguments
          still supported).

2/12/97 : Fixed default argument bug in Perl5 module when
          generating wrapper functions involving default
          arguments of complex datatypes.

2/12/97 : Fixed typemap scoping problems.  For example :

              %typemap(tcl,in) double {
                    .. get a double ..
              }

              class Foo {
              public:
                   double bar(double);
              }

              %typemap(tcl,in) double {
                    .. new get double ..
              }

          Would apply the second typemap to all functions in Foo
          due to delayed generation of C++ wrapper code (clearly this
          is not the desired effect).   Problem has been fixed by
          assigning unique numerical identifiers to every datatype in
          an interface file and recording the "range of effect" of each
          typemap.

2/11/97 : Added support for "ignore" and "default" typemaps.  Only use
          if you absolutely know what you're doing.

2/9/97  : Added automatic creation of constructors and destructors for
          C structs and C++ classes that do not specify any sort of
          constructor or destructor.   This feature can be enabled by
          running SWIG with the '-make_default' option or by inserting
          the following pragma into an interface file :

                 %pragma make_default

          The following pragma disables automatic constructor generation

                 %pragma no_default

2/9/97  : Added -make_default option for producing default constructors
          and destructors for classes without them.

2/9/97  : Changed the syntax of the SWIG %pragma directive to
          %pragma option=value or %pragma(lang) option=value.
          This change makes the syntax a little more consistent
          between general pragmas and language-specific pragmas.
          The old syntax still works, but will probably be phased
          out (a warning message is currently printed).

2/9/97  : Improved Tcl support of global variables that are of
          structures, classes, and unions.

2/9/97  : Fixed C++ compilation problem in Python 'embed.i' library file.

2/9/97  : Fixed missing return value in perlmain.i library file.

2/9/97  : Fixed Python shadow classes to return an AttributeError when
          undefined attributes are accessed (older versions returned
          a NameError).

2/9/97  : Fixed bug when %addmethods is used after a class definition whose
          last section is protected or private.

2/8/97  : Made slight changes in include file processing to support
          the Macintosh.

2/8/97  : Extended swigmain.cxx to provide a rudimentary Macintosh interface.
          It's a really bad interface, but works until something better
          is written.

1/29/97 : Fixed type-casting bug introduced by 1.1b4 when setting/getting the
          value of global variables involving complex data types.

1/29/97 : Removed erroneous white space before an #endif in the code generated
          by the Python module (was causing errors on DEC Alpha compilers).

1/26/97 : Fixed errors when using default/optional arguments in Python shadow
	  shadow classes.

1/23/97 : Fixed bug with nested %extern declarations.

1/21/97 : Fixed problem with typedef involving const datatypes.

1/21/97 : Somewhat obscure, but serious bug with having multiple levels
          of typedefs fixed.  For example :

		typedef char *String;
                typedef String  Name;

Version 1.1 Beta4 (January 16, 1997)
====================================

Note : SWIG 1.1b3 crashed and burned shortly after take off due
to a few major run-time problems that surfaced after release.
This release should fix most, if not all, of those problems.

1/16/97 : Fixed major memory management bug on Linux

1/14/97 : Fixed bug in functions returning constant C++ references.

1/14/97 : Modified C++ module to handle datatypes better.

1/14/97 : Modified parser to allow a *single* scope resolution
          operator in datatypes.  Ie : Foo::bar.   SWIG doesn't
          yet handle nested classes, so this should be
          sufficient for now.

1/14/97 : Modified parser to allow typedef inside a C++ class.

1/14/97 : Fixed some problems related to datatypes defined inside
          a C++ class.  SWIG was not generating correct code,
          but a new scoping mechanism and method for handling
          datatypes inside a C++ class have been added.

1/14/97 : Changed enumerations to use the value name instead
          of any values that might have appeared in the interface
          file.  This makes the code a little more friendly to
          C++ compilers.

1/14/97 : Removed typedef bug that made all enumerations
          equivalent to each other in the type checker (since
          it generated alot of unnecessary code).

Version 1.1 Beta3 (January 9, 1997)
===================================

Note : A *huge* number of changes related to ongoing modifications.

1.  Support for C++ multiple inheritance added.

2.  Typemaps added.

3.  Some support for nested structure definitions added.

4.  Default argument handling added.

5.  -c option added for building bare wrapper code modules.

6.  Rewrote Pointer type-checking to support multiple inheritance
    correctly.

7.  Tcl 8.0 module added.

8.  Perl4 and Guile modules resurrected from the dead (well, they
    at least work again).

9.  New Object Oriented Tcl interface added.

10. Bug fixes to Perl5 shadow classes.

11. Cleaned up many of the internal modules of the parser.

12. Tons of examples and testing modules added.

13. Fixed bugs related to use of "const" return values.

14. Fixed bug with C++ member functions returning void *.

15. Changed SWIG configuration script.

Version 1.1 Beta2 (December 3, 1996)
====================================

1. Completely rewrote the SWIG documentation system.  The changes
   involved are too numerous to mention.  Basically, take everything
   you knew about the old system, throw them out, and read the
   file Doc/doc.ps.

2. Limited support for #if defined() added.

3. Type casts are now allowed in constant expressions.  ie

         #define  A   (int) 3

4. Added support for typedef lists.  For example :

	typedef struct {
	        double x,y,z;
        } Vector, *VectorPtr;

5. New SWIG directives (related to documentation system)

	%style
	%localstyle
	%subsection
	%subsubsection

6. Reorganized the C++ handling and made it a little easier to
   work with internally.

7.  Fixed problem with inheriting data members in Python
    shadow classes.

8.  Fixed symbol table problems with shadow classes in both
    Python and Perl.

9.  Fixed annoying segmentation fault bug in wrapper code
    generated for Perl5.

10. Fixed bug with %addmethods directive.  Now it can be placed
    anywhere in a class.

11. More test cases added to the SWIG self-test.   Documentation
    tests are now performed along with other things.

12. Reorganized the SWIG library a little bit and set it up to
    self-document itself using SWIG.

13. Lots and lots of minor bug fixes (mostly obscure, but bugs
    nonetheless).


Version 1.1 Beta1 (October 30, 1996)
====================================

1. Added new %extern directive for handling multiple files

2. Perl5 shadow classes added

3. Rewrote conditional compilation to work better

4. Added 'bool' datatype

5. %{,%} block is now optional.

6. Fixed some bugs in the Python shadow class module

7. Rewrote all of the SWIG tests to be more informative
   (and less scary).

8. Rewrote parameter list handling to be more memory
   efficient and flexible.

9. Changed parser to ignore 'static' declarations.

10. Initializers are now ignored.  For example :

	struct FooBar a = {3,4,5};

11. Somewhat better parsing of arrays (although it's
    usually just a better error message now).

12. Lot's of minor bug fixes.


Version 1.0 Final (August 31, 1996)
===================================

1. Fixed minor bug in C++ module

2. Fixed minor bug in pointer type-checker when using
   -DALLOW_NULL.

3. Fixed configure script to work with Python 1.4beta3

4. Changed configure script to allow compilation without
   yacc or bison.

Version 1.0 Final (August 28, 1996)
===================================

1.  Changed parser to support more C/C++ datatypes (well,
    more variants).   Types like "unsigned", "short int",
    "long int", etc... now work.

2.  "unions" added to parser.

3.  Use of "typedef" as in :

	typedef struct {
	     double x,y,z;
	} Vector;

    Now works correctly.   The name of the typedef is used as
    the structure name.

4.  Conditional compilation with #ifdef, #else, #endif, etc...
    added.

5.  New %disabledoc, %enabledoc directives allow documentation
    to selectively be disabled for certain parts of a wrapper
    file.

6.  New Python module supports better variable linking, constants,
    and shadow classes.

7.  Perl5 module improved with better compatibility with XS
    and xsubpp.   SWIG pointers and now created so that they
    are compatible with xsubpp pointers.

8.  Support for [incr Tcl] namespaces added to Tcl module.

9.  %pragma directive added.

10. %addmethods directive added.

11. %native directive added to allow pre-existing wrapper functions
    to be used.

12. Wrote configure script for SWIG installation.

13. Function pointers now allowed with typedef statements.

14. %typedef modified to insert a corresponding C typedef into
    the output file.

15. Fixed some problems related to C++ references.

16. New String and WrapperFunction classes add to make generating
    wrapper code easier.

17. Fixed command line option processing to eliminate core dumps
    and to allow help messages.

18. Lot's of minor bug fixes to almost all code modules


Version 1.0 Beta 3 (Patch 1) July 17, 1996
==========================================

1.0 Final is not quite ready yet, but this release fixes a
number of immediate problems :

1.  Compiler errors when using -strict 1 type checking have been fixed.

2.  Pointer type checker now recognizes pointers of the form
    _0_Type correctly.

3.  A few minor fixes were made in the Makefile

Version 1.0 Beta 3 (June 14, 1996)
==================================


There are lots of changes in this release :

1.  SWIG is now invoked using the "swig" command instead of "wrap".
    Hey, swig sounds cooler.

2.  The SWIG_LIB environment variable can be set to change the
    location where SWIG looks for library files.

3.  C++ support has been added.   You should use the -c++ option
    to enable it.

4.  The %init directive has been replaced by the %module directive.
    %module constructs a valid name for the initialization function
    for whatever target language you're using (actually this makes
    SWIG files a little cleaner).  The old %init directive still works.

5.  The syntax of the %name directive has been changed.   Use of the
    old one should generate a warning message, but may still work.

6.  To support Tcl/Tk on non-unix platforms, SWIG imports a file called
    swigtcl.cfg from the $(SWIG_LIB)/tcl directory.   I don't have access
    to an NT machine, but this file is supposedly allows SWIG to
    produce wrapper code that compiles on both UNIX and non UNIX machines.
    If this doesn't work, you'll have to edit the file swigtcl.cfg. Please
    let me know if this doesn't work so I can update the file as
    necessary.

7.  The SWIG run-time typechecker has been improved.    You can also
    now redefine how it works by supplying a file called "swigptr.cfg"
    in the same directory as your SWIG interface files.   By default,
    SWIG reads this file from $(SWIG_LIB)/config.

8.  The documentation system has been changed to support the following :

	-  Documentation order is printed in interface file order by
           default.   This can be overridden by putting an %alpha
           directive in the beginning of the interface file.

        -  You can supply additional documentation text using

           %text %{ put your text here %}

        -  A few minor bugs were fixed.

9.  A few improvements have been made to the handling of command line
    options (but it's still not finished).

10.  Lots of minor bug fixes in most of the language modules have been
     made.

11. Filenames have been changed to 8.3 for compatibility with a SWIG
    port to non-unix platforms (work in progress).

12. C++ file suffix is now .cxx (for same reason).

13. The documentation has been upgraded significantly and is now
    around 100 pages.    I added new examples and a section on
    C++.  The documentation now includes a Table of Contents.

14. The SWIG Examples directory is still woefully sparse, but is
    getting better.

Special notice about C++
------------------------
This is the first version of SWIG to support C++ parsing.  Currently
the C++ is far from complete, but seems to work for simple cases.
No work has been done to add special C++ processing to any of
the target languages.   See the user manual for details about how
C++ is handled.   If you find problems with the C++ implementation,
please let me know.  Expect major improvements in this area.

Note : I have only successfully used SWIG and C++ with Tcl and
Python.

Notice about Version 1.0Final
-----------------------------

Version 1.0B3 is the last Beta release before version 1.0 Final is
released.  I have frozen the list of features supported in version 1.0
and will only fix bugs as they show up.  Work on SWIG version 2.0 is
already in progress, but is going to result in rather significant
changes to SWIG's internal structure (hopefully for the better).  No
anticipated date for version 2.0 is set, but if you've got an idea,
let me know.

Version 1.0 Beta 2 (April 26, 1996)
===================================

This release is identical to Beta1 except a few minor bugs are
fixed and the SWIG library has been updated to work with Tcl 7.5/Tk 4.1.
A tcl7.5 examples directory is now included.

- Fixed a bug in the Makefile that didn't install the libraries
  correctly.

- SWIG Library files are now updated to work with Tcl 7.5 and Tk 4.1.

- Minor bug fixes in other modules.


Version 1.0 Beta 1  (April 10, 1996).
=====================================

This is the first "semi-official" release of SWIG.    It has a
number of substantial improvements over the Alpha release.   These
notes are in no particular order--hope I remembered everything....

1.  Tcl/Tk

SWIG is known to work with Tcl7.3, Tk3.6 and later versions.
I've also tested SWIG with expect-5.19.

Normally SWIG expects to use the header files "tcl.h" and "tk.h".
Newer versions of Tcl/Tk use version numbers.   You can specify these
in SWIG as follows :

        % wrap -htcl tcl7.4.h -htk tk4.0.h example.i

Of course, I prefer to simply set up symbolic links between "tcl.h" and
the most recent stable version on the machine.

2.  Perl4

This implementation has been based on Perl-4.035.  SWIG's interface to
Perl4 is based on the documentation provided in the "Programming Perl"
book by Larry Wall, and files located in the "usub" directory of the
Perl4 distribution.

In order to compile with Perl4, you'll need to link with the uperl.o
file found in the Perl4 source directory.  You may want to move this
file to a more convenient location.

3.  Perl5

This is a somewhat experimental implementation, but is alot less
buggy than the alpha release.     SWIG operates independently of
the XS language and xsubpp supplied with Perl5.  Currently SWIG
produces the necessary C code and .pm file needed to dynamically
load a module into Perl5.

To support Perl5's notion of modules and packages (as with xsubpp),
you can use the following command line options :

        % wrap -perl5 -module MyModule -package MyPackage example.i

Note : In order for dynamic loading to be effective, you need to be
careful about naming.    For a module named "MyModule", you'll need to
create a shared object file called "MyModule.so" using something like

        % ld -shared my_obj.o -o MyModule.so

The use of the %init directive must match the module name since Perl5
calls a function "boot_ModuleName" in order to initialize things.
See the Examples directory for some examples of how to get things
to work.

4.  Python1.3

This is the first release supporting Python.    The Python port is
experimental and may be rewritten.   Variable linkage is done through
functions which is sort of a kludge.  I also think it would be nice
to import SWIG pointers into Python as a new object (instead of strings).
Of course, this needs a little more work.

5.  Guile3

If you really want to live on the edge, pick up a copy of Guile-iii and
play around with this.      This is highly experimental---especially since
I'm not sure what the official state of Guile is these days.  This
implementation may change at any time should I suddenly figure out better
ways to do things.

6.  Extending SWIG

SWIG is written in C++ although I tend to think of the code as mostly
being ANSI C with a little inheritance thrown in.   Each target language
is implemented as a C++ class that can be plugged into the system.
If you want to add your own modifications, see Appendix C of the user
manual.   Then take a look at the "user" directory which contains some
code for building your own extenions.

7. The SWIG library

The SWIG library is still incomplete.  Some of the files mentioned in
the user manual are unavailable.    These files will be made available
when they are ready.   Subscribe to the SWIG mailing list for announcements
and updates.

8. SWIG Documentation

I have sometimes experienced problems viewing the SWIG documentation in
some postscript viewers.   However, the documentation seems to print
normally.    I'm working on making much of the documentation online,
but this takes time.

Version 0.1 Alpha (February 9, 1996)
====================================

1.  Run-time type-checking of SWIG pointers.   Pointers are now represented
    as strings with both numeric and encoded type information.    This makes
    it a little harder to shoot yourself in the foot (and it eliminates
    some segmentation faults and other oddities).

2.  Python 1.3 now supported.

3.  #define and enum can be used to install constants.

4.  Completely rewrote the %include directive and made it alot more powerful.

5.  Restructured the SWIG library to make it work better.

6.  Various bug fixes to Tcl, Perl4, Perl5, and Guile implementations.

7.  Better implementation of %typedef directive.

8.  Made some changes to SWIG's class structure to make it easier to expand.
    SWIG is now built into a library file that you can use to make your
    own extenions.

9.  Made extensive changes to the documentation.

10. Minor changes to the SWIG parser to make it use less memory.
    Also took out some extraneous rules that were undocumented and
    didn't work in the first place.

11. The SWIG library files "tclsh", "wish", "expect", etc... in the first
    release have been restructured and renamed to "tclsh.i", "wish.i",
    and so on.
