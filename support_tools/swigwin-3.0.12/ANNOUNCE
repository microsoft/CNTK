What is SWIG?
=============

SWIG is a software development tool that reads C/C++ header files and
generates the wrapper code needed to make C and C++ code accessible
from other programming languages including Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby,
PHP, C#, Go, Java, Javascript, Lua, Scheme (Guile, MzScheme, CHICKEN),
D, Ocaml, Pike, Modula-3, Octave, R, Scilab, Common Lisp (CLISP,
Allegro CL, CFFI, UFFI).  SWIG can also export its parse tree in
the form of XML and Lisp s-expressions.  Major applications of SWIG
include generation of scripting language extension modules, rapid
prototyping, testing, and user interface development for large
C/C++ systems.
