Python Wrapper API for CNTK 1.5
===============================

CNTK_, the Computational Network Toolkit, is a system for describing, training,
and executing computational networks, a unified framework for describing
arbitrary learning machines, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short term
memory (LSTM), logistic regression, and maximum entropy model. CNTK is an 
implementation of computational networks that supports both CPU and GPU.
 
This page describes the Python Wrapper for CNTK_ version 1.5. This is an ongoing effort
to expose such an API to the CNTK system, thus enabling the use of higher-level
tools such as IDEs to facilitate the definition of computational networks, to execute
them on sample data in real time.
