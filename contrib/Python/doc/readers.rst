Readers
===============

Data readers are used by the computational network to provide information about the data, 
to load minibatches of data into memory, and to attach this memory to the input nodes in 
the network. The CNTK Python API currently supports the following reader classes.

Usage
-------

.. autoclass:: cntk.reader.CNTKTextFormatReader
   :members:

.. autoclass:: cntk.reader.InputMap
