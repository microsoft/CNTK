    # ==================
    # Reshaping is just moving the input values to different indexes of the result tensor.
    # If we would compute the gradients on the unmodified reshape would would get 1 for all inputs.
    # For testing the gradients we want to have different gradients for each input index otherwise we can't
    # test if they get wrongly permuted during test. To this end we multiply the reshaping result with some weight tensor. 
    # For convienience choose '100 * expected_tensor' as weight.
    # The expected gradient is identical to this weight tensor reshaped according the input shape.
